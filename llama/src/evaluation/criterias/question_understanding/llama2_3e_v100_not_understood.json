        "true_answer": "(a) The function “patient admission” is decomposed into five subfunctions—patient admission is only complete if all the subfunctions are completed.

There are no examples of specialization at the domain layer of Fig. 2.11.\n\n(b) The function “patient identification” updates the entity type “patient.” The function “medical admission” uses the entity type “patient.” This indicates that identifying patient data are updated or created during patient admission and then used for medical admission.\n \n(c) The entity type “privacy statement” could be added at the domain layer. It would be updated by the function “obtaining consent for processing of patient data.”\n \n(d) Patient admission is decomposed into five subfunctions with each being linked to an application component by which it is supported.

        "true_answer": "(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.\n(b) The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type “patient,” for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.\n(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.\n(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.\nPros (examples):\n- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.\n- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.\n\nCons (examples):\n- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.\n- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.\n\nResolving these redundancies (examples):\n- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.\n- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.\n\n(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).\n\nThe application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.\n \n(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do",

        "true_answer": "1. A physician enters a medical diagnosis for a patient first in the MDMS and later, when ordering an X-ray, again in the CPOE system. → No data integration, resulting in reentering of data, which is time-consuming and may lead to errors and inconsistencies in the data, which has the potential for patient harm.\n \n2. The position of the patient’s name and the formatting of the patient’s birthdate vary between the MDMS and the CPOE system. → No user interface integration, resulting in increased time effort when using various application components, increased time needed for user training, and increased risk in overlooking or misinterpreting important patient information, which has the potential for patient harm.\n \n3. When physicians shift from the MDMS to the CPOE system, they have to log in again and again search for the correct patient. → No context integration, leading to an increase in time needed to shift between application systems and an increased risk for selecting the wrong patient in the second application systems, which has the potential for patient harm.\n \n4. The CPOE system and the RIS use slightly different catalogs of available radiology examinations. → No semantic integration, making the exchange and reuse of patient information in both application systems challenging.\n \n5. When physicians write the discharge letter for a patient in the MDMS, they also have to code the discharge diagnosis of a patient. For this coding, they have to use a feature that is only available in the patient administration system, so they have to shift to this application system. → No feature integration, leading to increased time needed to shift to the patient administration system.\n \n6.
