        "true_answer": "The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.\nIt comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.\nIt is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.\nYet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for a clinical trial and their data are entered into an EDC system.\nFurthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes, as do rehabilitation facilities and—to a limited extent—wellness or sports facilities.\nFor personal environments, medical admission also plays a role, especially in telecare situations or when prevention measures are conducted, respectively.",

        "true_answer": "Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.\n\nSemantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.\n\nUser interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.\nFor example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.\n\nContext integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.\nThe nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.\n\nFeature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.\n\nProcess integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",
