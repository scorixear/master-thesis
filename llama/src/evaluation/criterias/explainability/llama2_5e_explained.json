Answer the question to your best knowledge.\nQuestion: A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospital has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.\nDisease registers are research databases for collecting data about a specific disease, aiming for full coverage of the respective patient collective.\nThe aim of a knee endoprosthesis registry is to collect longitudinal data to find out which type of endoprosthesis works best over time.\nThe researcher wants to integrate data from patient-reported outcome questionnaires, findings from inpatient or outpatient visits at the hospital, and results from laboratory examinations.\nWhich entity types need to be integrated and from which application components do they come? Devise a plan how you would set up a sustainable research architecture, i.e., an architecture that also could be used in other research settings and for different disease or research entities, considering Sect. 6.6.\nAnswer:",
