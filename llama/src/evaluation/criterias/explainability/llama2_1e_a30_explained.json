        "true_answer": "A good models should be able to help understand and predict the behavior of the system or process. It should also be able to help design and evaluate health information systems. A reference architecture can be used to support the design of a proper HIS architecture that meets the various stakeholder concerns of HISs. This architecture should be able to show the HIS from a different angle, suitable for various stakeholders.",
