Efficient process organization is extremely important, for example, in outpatient units or outpatient units, and can be supported, for example, by providing working lists for individual staff members by issuing reminders about appointments or by visualizing actual process flow.\n The facility’s information system must be able to support communication of all involved units and facilities involved in patient care.\n This comprises, for example, synchronous (e.g., telephone) and asynchronous (e.g., blackboards, brochures, email) communication.\n Staff members must be able to be contacted within a prescribed period of time.\n \n **Supply and Disposal Management**\n Supply and disposal of materials, food, drugs, and so on must be guaranteed.\n - Catering\n - Material and medication management\n - Laundry management\n - Management of medical devices\n - Scheduling and resource allocation\n \n **Human Resources Management**\n - This contains all tasks for the development and improvement of the productivity of staff.\n - It comprises, for example, staff and position planning, the staff register, staff scheduling, and staff payroll.\n - administration of human resource master data,\n - human resource planning,\n - work organization and time management,\n - payroll accounting,\n - administration of business trips and further training.\n - performance of legal notification requirements, for example, data on quality of life.\n \n #### Reference Management of Information Systems (RMIS)\n The facility must be able to document the facility’s information processing in an accurate, complete, quick, and patient-oriented way.\n This is only possible if the information systems are systematically planned, monitored, and directed.\n \n Management of information systems can be differentiated into strategic,",

        "true_answer": "The following entity types have to be integrated: patient, person, diagnosis, finding, health record, medical procedure, patient record, self-gathered symptoms, material, medical device, classification, nomenclature.\n\nApplication components to be integrated depend on local settings and implementation but will likely include: patient administration system, MDMS, LIS, OMS, PDMS, and self-diagnosis systems (e.g., an app for collecting patient-reported outcome data) or patient portals.\n\nA research architecture for setting up multiple registries might include a DWS for research that is fed via ETL processes from the above-mentioned application components and can be tapped for data in different use cases or research scenarios.\nFinally, an open platform architecture would enable reuse of patient data in various research contexts.",
