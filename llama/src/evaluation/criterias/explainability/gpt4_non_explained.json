In general, Germany has historically sourced care workers from various regions, including Eastern Europe and the Philippines, among others. However, for the most accurate information, you may want to refer to the latest resources or news updates.",

Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices\n- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings\n- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations\n- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work\n- Conclusion: We discovered several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health\n\nThe authors found several factors that may hinder or foster the use of CDS in primary care.\nThe results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.",
