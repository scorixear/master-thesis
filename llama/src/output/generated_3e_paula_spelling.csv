 #### 3.3.2.2 Evaluation of Health Information Systems
 Evaluation of health information systems is the act of measuring or exploring components of such systems.
 The result of such evaluation is an evaluation report.
 
 Evaluation of health information systems is an ongoing process, and there are no use in trying to solve all evaluation problems at the same time.
 Solely a stepwise approach, based on different levels of priorities, is feasible.
 
 Evaluation of health information systems is typically conducted in the form of evaluation studies.
 For example, a study of the structure, processes, and outcomes of the health information system of a hospital may show that the hospital’s information system is well-designed and well-supported.
 Such a study would be useful for management of information systems.

Ist openEHR ein Standard?,Is openEHR a standerd?,"
 
 “OpenEHR (Sect. 3.7.2.2) is the most comprehensive and well-established standard in the health care domain.
 It supports the semantic interoperability of application systems and, for example, their syntactic interoperability.
 
 It can be used for the standardized representation of clinical documents between health care facilities and for the standardized representation of clinical research (trial) data.
 
 It also supports the standardized representation of clinical research (trial) data.
 
 It is an open standard, which means that the specification, the standard’s “Sect. 3.7.2, and the corresponding source code are published and can be used by any vendor.
 
 It has gained widespread acceptance in the health care domain because it supports syntactic interoperability (Sect. 3.7.2), supports semantic interoperability (Sect. 3.7.2), and also supports standardized document filing (Sect. 3.7.2).
 
 It is also important to note that the specification follows a thorough (maximum) approach and provides comprehensive and unambiguous terminology.
 
 For example, the specification includes the complete Sect. 3.7.2, which is about 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","Yes, openEHR is an open standard specification in health informatics that describes the management and storage, retrieval and exchange of health data in electronic health records.",1,single,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

Answer: "
Was tut ein Kommunikationsserver?,What does a comunication server do in the context of health information sistems?,"
 A communication server is an application system used for the asynchronous receiving, buffering, and sending of messages.
 It can also be used for monitoring the traffic between application systems.
 
 A communication server is useless without communication links.
 The following section provides a list of standard communication protocols.
 
 #### 3.7.2 Interoperability Standards
 As said before, the costs of the implementation and maintenance of interfaces within heterogeneous health information systems can be significantly reduced when standards for interoperability are used.
 
 Within the logical tool layer of a health information system, there exist a list of standards for interoperability, i.e., for the asynchronous receiving, buffering, and sending of messages.
 These interoperability standards cover a wide range of application systems, i.e., from simple terminal (Sect. 3.10) to comprehensive application systems (Sect. 3.11).
 
 As the most widely implemented and wellestablished interoperability standards, HL7 V2 messages and DICOM will be described.
 However, there are more.
 HL7 CDA is a document standard developed in the 1990s.
 It can be used for the standardized representation of clinical documents within health information systems.
 
 HL7 FHIR is a recent standard developed in the 20s.
 It focuses on the standardized representation of clinical information in the form of transferable documents (e.g., a discharge letter or a lab result).
 
 HL7 V2 messages
 HL7 V2 messages are the most-implemented communication standard in health care.
 They comprise two parts: the CDA message and the HL7 FHIR message.
 The following section provides an overview of the most relevant interoperability standards in health care.
 
 #### 3.7.2.1 HL7 V2
 HL7 V2 is the most-implemented communication standard in health care.
 It comprises two parts: the CDA message and the HL7 FHIR Message.
 
 The following section provides an overview of the most relevant interoperability standards in health care.

 The laboratory information system is based on software from LIS.
 LIS also offers hardware virtualization and various export formats, most notably using the ISO/OSI reference model.
 
 #### 3.7.2.13 Application Systems for Patients
 In contrast to the previously described application systems in health care facilities, application systems for patients cannot be structured that clearly by the questions and the answers.
 This is due to the fact that there are a multitude of mobile health (mHealth apps), desktop, and browser applications available for patients.
 
 In the following section, you will learn about some of the most important application systems for patients.
 
 ### 3.7.2.13.1 Patient Administration Systems
 Patient administration systems are used by hospitals, for example, to support the administrative functions of a patient’s stay.
 They comprise the administrative patient record, the administrative patient index, and a number of other features.
 
 The Patient Administration system is the master application system for the administrative patient record.
 It contains the administrative patient record as a document Collection, for example, in a record cabinet.
 The Patient Administration system also contains an index of all the patients’ stays at a particular hospital.
 This is the so-called administrative patient index (Sect. 3.7.2).
 
 The Patient Administration system is an important tool for administrative staff, for example, in a hospital, as it supports the retrieval of administrative patient data and the management of the administrative patient record.
 
 ### 3.7.2.13.2 Patient Data Management Systems
 Patient data management systems are offered by health care facilities.
 They are primarily available for the patients of this facility and inform them about their data, organize documents, and actively manage these themselves.
 
 In addition to the Patient Administration system, which focuses on the administrative patient record, there are also specialized MDMS for document management.
 These offer customizable data entry forms and various export formats, most notably using the ISO/OSI reference Model.
 
 The Patient Data Management system (PDMS) is an important tool for administrative staff, for example, in a hospital, as it supports the retrieval",Laboratory Information System,1,single,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.

 Short-term advantages: The communication server can handle the communication between all four application systems. It also supports the monitoring of the communication traffic.
 It thus supports data integration in heterogeneous health information systems.
 
 Long-term advantages: In the resulting (AC^n, CP1) architecture, new application systems can easily be integrated.
 
 Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used as a syntactic or semantic standard.
 
 #### 3.9.2 Data Integration
 Imagine a health information system where data are stored in one database system.
 The data are then retrievable by querying this database system.
 
 Data integration is the first step of data integration within heterogeneous health information systems.
 It comprises the retrieval of data from one database system and the provision of these data to another database system or to research application.
 
 Data integration is a precondition for data integration in heterogeneous health information systems.
 
 Assume that the nurse Peter Smith wants to order a radiological examination from the radiology department of the hospital.
 The nurse would first log in to the NMDS and create the user context “Peter Smith.” Then Peter searches for the radiology report of the patient Jakub Russo.
 The NMDS sends back the radiology report of the patient Peter Russo to the RIS.
 The RIS sends back the order for the radiological examination to the radiology department of the hospital.
 
 Data integration thus supports data and knowledge sharing between health care professionals and between health care facilities.
 
 In the resulting health information system, data and knowledge sharing between health care professionals and between health care facilities is supported.
 
 In the resulting health information system, data and knowledge sharing between health care professionals and between health care facilities is supported.

It can also be used for monitoring the communication traffic.
The communication server thus supports data integration in heterogeneous information system architectures.

Long-term advantages: In the resulting (ACn, CP1) architecture, new application components can easily be integrated, as only one communication interface to the communication server needs to be implemented.

Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used as syntactic or semantic standard.

 The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an application system that provides a paper-based data privacy form, for example, with the patient’s name, address, and insurance data, to the CPOE system.
 The CPOE system then sends a message (e.g., “patient Mr. Russo”) with the patient’s administrative patient data to the patient management system.
 The patient management system then sends a message (e.g., “patient Mr. Russo has been admitted to Ploetzberg Hospital”) to the RIS.
 
 The RIS is an application system that provides a correct, complete, and timely administrative patient record, for example, to the radiologist, to the laboratory, or to the cardiologist, with the correct patient identification number (PIN).
 
 The RIS is an important tool for the radiologist, for example, because it supports the correctness of the radiological report.
 
 The radiologist’s report is then sent from the radiology information system to the ordering unit, for example, the ordering unit in the radiology department of a hospital.
 The radiology information system is an application system that also provides a correctness of the radiological report.
 
 The radiology report is then sent from the radiology information system to the ordering unit.
 The radiology information system also provides a correctness of the radiological report.

 HL7 V2 is the most-implemented communication standard in hospital information systems for the transfer of messages with data on the entity types “patient” and “case” and the other entity types as described in Sect. 3.2.
 
 HL7 V2 has been maintained by the international standards organization Health Level Seven International (HL7) since the 1990s.
 It can be best considered as a standard to support mainly syntactic interoperability between application systems.
 
 HL7 V2 consists of two parts: the message-oriented part and the service-oriented part.
 The message-oriented part is also called HL7 FHIR.
 
 The message-oriented part of HL7 V2 is the part where messages with data on the entity types “patient” and “case” are created and communicated.
 It supports syntactic interoperability and the use of standardized terminology.
 
 The message-oriented part of HL7 V2 is further described in Sect. 3.7.2.
 
 The service-oriented part of HL7 V2 is the part where application systems provide or solve a service for a patient.
 It supports semantic interoperability and the use of standardized terminology.
 
 The service-oriented part of HL7 V2 is further described in Sect. 3.7.3.

Question: How are HL7, DICOM realted?
Answer: "
Was ist Transaktionsmanagement? Wie wird das in KIS organisiert?,What is transaction managment? How is it orginised in HIS?,"
 Transaction management ensures that every update of correct data in one or more database systems will lead to another state in which the data in the other database system(s) are still correct.
 This turns out to be not trivial, especially for complex update operations, the so-called transactions.
 
 Transaction management guarantees that the application system will automatically follow patient, user, and other contexts.
 It also provides a correctness of the overall health information system’s architecture.
 
 In order to achieve integration in “best-of-breed architectures,” application systems need to share and store the same data.
 Data integration is the first and quite basic function within heterogeneous health information systems, as it provides data that can be used in more than one application system.
 
 Data integration is the process that copies data from one database system to another, while preserving data integrity.
 
 Data integration has two effects:
 
 It supports data sharing and thus data integration within heterogeneous health information systems.
 It also supports data consistency, i.e., the correctness of data, which is an important precondition for --> data integrity.
 
 In the following section, we will discuss the more complex functions of data, information, and knowledge processing.
 
 ## 2.16 Data, Information, and Knowledge Processing
 In this section, we will discuss data, information, and knowledge processing in more detail.
 
 Assume a clinical researcher wants to order a radiological examination of a patient.
 The radiologist will then report back to the ordering facility.
 The radiologist’s report will include the radiological report and the relevant dose.
 The radiologist will also include a report on the general state of the patient’s health.
 The radiologist’s report is the basis for the ordering physician’s decision.
 The radiologist’s report is sent from the radiology department to the ordering unit.
 The radiology report is then sent from the ordering unit to the ordering physician.
 The radiology report is the basis for the ordering physician’s decision.
 
 We will now discuss the more complex functions of data, information, and knowledge processing.

","Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

"A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospital has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.
Disease registers are research databases for collecting data about a specific disease, aiming for full coverage of the respective patient collective.
The aim of a knee endoprosthesis registry is to collect longitudinal data to find out which type of endoprosthesis works best over time.
The researcher wants to integrate data from patient-reported outcome questionnaires, findings from inpatient or outpatient visits at the hospital, and results from laboratory examinations.
Which entity types need to be integrated and from which application components do they come? Devise a plan how you would set up a sustainable research architecture, i.e., an architecture that also could be used in other research settings and for different disease or research entities, considering Sect. 6.6.","A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospitul has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.

 The following entity types need to be integrated: “discharge letter,” “finding,” “order,” “report,” and “registry.”
 
 Application components to be integrated depend on local settings and settings.
 In general, for research purposes, a discharge letter is necessary to discharge a patient from a hospital or a medical office.
 The discharge letter includes the relevant diagnoses, relevant questions, and recommendations for further treatment.
 The discharge letter is sent from the discharging facility to the receiving facility.
 The receiving facility confirms the receipt of the discharge letter through a receipt message (ACK) that is sent back to the discharging facility.
 If a communication server such as in Sect. 3.9.3 is used to send a discharge letter, for example, from the patient administration system to the RIS, then the communication server first takes over the role of the receiving facility. As a second step, the communication server, as the sending facility, sends the discharge letter to the RIS.
 
 The following application components need to be integrated: the patient administration system, the RIS, and the patient data management system (PDMS). These and the previously mentioned application components support the execution of radiologic examinations.

Application components to be integrated depend on local settings and implementation but will likely include: patient administration system, MDMS, LIS, OMS, PDMS, and self-diagnosis systems (e.g., an app for collecting patient-reported outcome data) or patient portals.

A research architecture for setting up multiple registries might include a DWS for research that is fed via ETL processes from the above-mentioned application components and can be tapped for data in different use cases or research scenarios.
