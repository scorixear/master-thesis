 The better a model assists its users in answering a given question, the better the respective answer is.
 Thus, the selection of the adequate model depends on the problems or questions to be answered.
 
 There exists a large number of different and often conflicting models, which can be used to answer the various questions.
 Each model leads to specific insights and can be used to support the respective strategic decisions.
 
 This section provides an overview of some of the most important and well-established models in health care settings.
 These include models for strategic management of information systems, strategic monitoring, strategic directing, and strategic monitoring.
 
 ### 2.14.1 Strategic Management of Information Systems
 Strategic management of information systems deals with the information system as a whole.
 It depends on the business goals of the health care facility and the strategic information management plan.
 
 Strategic management of information systems and its strategic information management plan are the prerequisites for tactical and operational management of information systems.
 These depend on the specific situation of the health care facility and the management of information systems and on the strategic information management plan.

 ### 4.8.3 Strategic Monitoring Activities by Evaluation Projects
 An information system of a health care facility is typically too complex to allow all its components to be monitored at the same time.
 However, it is useful to define a subset of criteria to be monitored on a regular basis.
 Quantitative criteria can be better processed and compared.
 
 In general, monitoring comprises all activities that continuously audit and assesss a component of a health care facility.
 Auditing determines whether the information system is able to meet its tasks, i.e., whether it contributes significantly to the vision and mission of the health care facility, meets the stakeholders’ requirements (Sect. 1.​3), and fulfills the relevant laws.
 To allow auditing, monitoring needs to receive information from various sources, for example, on the successful implementation of projects, the adoption of standards, and the availability of new user groups.
 In addition, monitoring results may influence the planning of projects, for example, in case of changes in the vision and mission of the health care facility.
 
 Typically, monitoring comprises activities such as permanent monitoring activities, ad hoc monitoring activities, and evaluation studies.
 These are explained in more detail in the following sections.
 
 ### 4.8.4 Strategic Directing
 Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of planning the information system and monitoring the results of its monitoring in the context of data warehousing.
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., system of concepts, into action.
 The system of concepts is a description of what the health care facility is and what it stands for.
 For university medical centers, for example, it is stipulated by law that they must offer the basic functions of patient care, medical research, and teaching of future physicians.
 
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is systematically updating the strategic information management plan to make it conform to the reality of the health care facility.",Executing work packages within an evaluation project of a CPOE system: tactical directing,1,single,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

 Planning, as part of strategic management of information systems, collects and defines the business goals of the health care facility.
 As a result, it formulates strategic information management plans.
 
 Directing, as part of strategic monitoring, collects and analyzed the business goals of the health care facility.
 It also collects and analyzes the strategic information management plan.
 
 Monitoring, as part of strategic monitoring, collects and analyzes the business goals of the health care facility.
 It also collects and analyzes the strategic information management plan.
 
 Typically, the CIO, supported by the information management department, creates and maintains a proposal for the strategic information management plan.
 This proposal includes the business goals of the health care facility, the strategic information management plan, the current state of the information system, the future state of the information system, and the steps to transform the current into the planned information system.
 
 An application system of the health care facility is an integration of many different, yet interrelated application systems.
 We can also say that the application system of a health care facility is a --> system of many different, yet interrelated application systems.
 We will now refer to the application system of the health care facility as a --> system of many different, yet interrelated application systems.
 
 The interoperability standard open Electronic Health Record (openEHR) provides a universal, agreed information model.
 
 Open platforms were first used in professional health care settings.
 For example, the open platform for the entity type “patient” was developed for the Austrian ELGA (national EHR) in order to provide a common information model for all health care facilities.
 
 For example, the patient administration system is implemented based on an open platform.
 Thus, it is technically independent of the specific implementation or customizing of a health information system.

Answer the question to your best knowledge.
Question: Define the term ""hospital information system"".
Answer: "
Wie erhalten Apotheker:innen Zugriff auf verordnete eRezepte?,How do pharmacists get access to e-prescriptions?,"
 The patient administration system is the primary application system for the entity type “patient.” Therefore, the prerequisite for access to the entity type “patient” is to be admitted to the ward.
 
 ### 3.9.3 Administration of Health care Facilities
 Administration of health care facilities decides on questions of fundamental importance for the patients’ health and life.
 These are, for example, decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, about the application systems to be used (e.g., which application systems for order entry should be used), and about the physical data processing tools to be used (e.g., which physical data processing tools for order entry should be used).
 
 ### 3.9.4 Management of Information Systems
 Information systems need systematic management.
 In general, management comprises all leadership activities that determine the goals, structures, and behaviors of a setting.
 As a function, management comprises planning, directing, and monitoring a specific object or a group of objects.
 Within a setting, a person can be considered a strategic or tactical manager of information systems, depending on the role of the person in the setting.
 We will now discuss in more detail strategic and tactical management of information systems.
 
 ### 3.9.5 Strategic Management of Information Systems
 Strategic management of information systems deals with the information system as a whole.
 It depends on the business goals of the health care facility and the role of management of information systems in this facility.
 
 The strategic information management plan is the basis for all tactical and operational information systems of the health care facility.
 This plan describes the business goals, the information management goals, the current state of the information system, the future state of the information system, and the steps to transform the current into the planned information system.
 
 Strategic management of information systems must be based on established best practice frameworks and standards, such as COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology).
 COBIT is an international framework for IT governance that defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT systems in an organization for each of its strategic goals.
 COBIT defines objectives, key activities, inputs and outputs, and performance measures.

 ### 3.11.3 Information Logistics
 
 `Information and knowledge logistics aims at a correct representation of a health care setting and its stakeholder groups, their interests, and the risks they are exposed to.`
 
 The concept of information and knowledge logistics was developed in the 1990s and has been refined by various researchers.
 
 The basis of information and knowledge logistics is that objects have attributes (such as duration or amount) that can be exactly measured.
 To obtain data representative for a predefined population, a sampling is selected and then analyzed.
 
 Typical quantitative evaluation methods comprise time measurements, quantitative observations, or quantitative surveys.
 
 Time measurements comprise time-motion analyses or work-sampling studies.
 The time-motion analysis is based on trained observers that measure the duration of observed events (e.g., login to a component or a user session) while using a predefined list of event categories.
 Typically, for time-motion analysis, one observer is needed for each actor (e.g., user), which is quite resource-intensive.
 This disadvantage is resolved by the work sampling analysis.
 Here, trained observers document which is being executed only at predefined (e.g., every 5 min) or randomly selected time intervals.
 This allows them to observe several actors in parallel.
 By counting the number of observations in each category, the overall distribution and thus the duration of each category can be calculated.
 To obtain precise numbers, however, this requires a relatively large number of observations to be done.
 Please note that both approaches (time-motion and work sampling) are typically conducted by trained external observers, though they can in principle also be conducted by the actors (e.g., users) themselves—this, however, may limit the quality of the data.
 
 Quantitative surveys use standardized, closed questions that lead to quantitative results.
 For questionnaires addressing subjective opinions and feelings, the 5-point Likert scale is often used (“strongly agree”—“agree”—","tHIS stands for transinstitutional health information system, an information system of a health care network which consists of multiple health care settings (contexts).

Was ist openEHR,What is openEHR?,"
 Hinweis: openEHR is an open standard specification which focuses on the standardized representation of clinical information in EHRs. It has been maintained by the openEHR Foundation since the early 2006 and supports semantic and syntactic interoperability. 
 Hinweis: openEHR is the most widely used standard in hospital information systems for the representation of clinical information.
 
 ### 3.7.3 Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR)
 HL7 FHIR (Fast Health care Interoperability Resources) is a recent HL7 standard based on the experience from other HL7 standards that was developed in and has been continuously updated since 2016.
 The focus is on sharing medical data in terms of transferring them from one application system to another in a standardized manner and thus make medical data portable.
 FHIR supports technical interoperability by using web technologies for data exchange, most notably REST APIs for programmers and simple HTTP operations for data access.
 It also supports syntactic interoperability by defining a complete EHR model in just a few minutes.
 
 The two basic building blocks are information models called “resources” which represent clinical, identifying, and financial information as well as APIs.
 The basic resources follow the so-called 80/800 approach, i.e., to meet 80000001’s needs by implementing 80002 rules.
 FHIR neither aims to cover all clinical information nor to provide an EHR for the entire health care setting.
 Rather, it focuseseses on frequent, generic use cases.
 FHIR develops the FHIR specification and manages the resources, for which it also defines a number of rules on how to create them.
 
 FHIR provides terminology linking and validation.
 LOINC, for example, can be linked to the FHIR specification and used for validation.

 ## 2.2 Information Systems in Health care Settings
 ### 2.2.1 Characteristics of Health care Settings
 Health care settings usually are settings where patients with acute and chronic diseases receive inpatient and, partially, outpatient treatment.
 
 The most important working areas in health care settings are wards, outpatient units, service units (e.g., diagnostic units such as the radiology department, the laboratory department), and, for example, the patient administration system.
 The most important persons in health care settings are, obviously, patients.
 Important groups of persons working in health care settings are nurses as well as administrative and management staff.
 
 ### 2.2.2 Technological Perspective
 In health care settings, the functions to be performed are mainly those of nurses and administrative staff.
 The functions to be performed by patients and their informal caregivers are, for example, to provide support for their relatives or to seek advice via the internet.
 
 The most important application system in health care settings is the nursing management and documentation system (NMDS) that supports major functions such as patient administration, decision-making, planning, organization of patient treatment, and coding.
 
 ### 2.3 Management Perspective
 Management of information systems in health care settings is typically reduced.
 Often, senior nursing managers will be responsible for organizing management of",The Architecture of Integrated Information Systems is a framework for describing business processes.

 1. Functions of the health care setting (e.g., diagnostic and therapeutic departments, or the radiology department) can be modeled.
 2. Entity types (e.g., name, birthdate, insurance data, or lab data) that are used in the health care setting can be modeled.
 3. An entity type or a function cannot be specialized and decomposed at the same time.
 4. When modeling a function, the activities regarding the function should be decomposed only to that level of detail needed to describe the support of the function by single application components.
 
 ### 2.15.3 Modeling Logical Tool Layer
 #### 2.15.3.1 Inter-layer Relationships
 At the --> logical tool layer, relationships between entity types and functions are modeled—both for expressing the installation of an entity type in a health care setting and for the use of an entity type in such a setting.
 The following relationships between entity types and functions can be modeled at the --> logical tool layer:
 - Functions use input data on certain entity types.
 - An entity type is used and updated by a function.
 - Functions can be decomposed, but not specialized.
 - Entity type can be decomposed, but not specialized.
 - Functions are only performed in certain parts of health care settings.

Was ist IHE?,What is IHE?,"
 IHE is a recent standard based on existing standards and standards processes that was developed in and has been continuously updated by the IHE Foundation.
 
 IHE in general is not a standards body as such but fills a very important gap by selecting the three or four standards which it considers to be most relevant for the respective use case.
 Hinweis: IHE considers the use of some of the standards to be “best-of-breed” and therefore selected only the standards which the health care facility combines to best support its business processes.
 
 In the following section, we will explain step by step how and under which conditions the above-mentioned standards can be used in the health care facility.
 
 ### 3.7.1 Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR)
 HL7 FHIR (Fast Health care Interoperability Resources) is a recent HL7 standard based on the experience from other HL7 standards that was developed in and has been continuously updated by the FHIR specification Committee.
 FHIR supports the development of application systems that can receive as well as provide patient-related data on demand.
 For example, a server can provide a GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, and PUT-ACK of patient-related data on demand.
 FHIR provides terminology linking and validation.
 
 ### 3.7.2 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)
 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is an open standard maintained by the DICOM Standards Committee of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) since the early 200s.
 The DICOM Standard is built upon web technologies, most notably REST APIs and simple HTTP operations.
 The focus is on sharing medical data in terms of transferring them from one application system to another in a standardized manner and thus make medical data portable.
 FHIR supports technical interoperability by defining a complete process for sharing medical data.
 
 The two basic building blocks are information models called “resources” which represent clinical, identifying, and financial information as well as APIs.
 The basic resources follow the so-called 80/800 approach",IHE stands for Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise. It is an initiative by healthcare professionals and industry to improve the way computer systems in healthcare share information. IHE promotes the coordinated use of established standards such as DICOM and HL7 to address specific clinical needs in support of optimal patient care,1,single,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.
Question: What is IHE?
Answer: "
Was tut ein Kommunikationsserver?,What does a communication server do  in the context of health information systems?,"
 A communication server is an application system used for the asynchronous receiving, buffering, transforming, and multicasting of --> messages. It can also be used for monitoring the traffic.
 
 The application system can receive, store, transform, and multicast a variety of --> messages.
 These can be, for example, messages regarding admission, discharge, or transfer of a patient, or perhaps a message regarding a medical device.
 The application system will transform the received data into a coherent, uniform, and multicast-proofed information.
 The data can be provided to other application systems either in a continuous or intermittent way.
 
 The application system can store and provide a vast amount of data.
 Data can be provided to other application systems, for example, in a continuous way.
 
 The application system can transform data into a coherent, uniform, and multicast-proofed information.
 Data can be provided to other application systems, for example, in a continuous way.
 
 The application system can store and provide a vast amount of data.
 Data can be provided to other application systems, for example, in a continuous way.
 
 ### 3.9.3 Open Platforms
 An application system is called open platform if it stores patient-related data based on open specifications and open information models and provides open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for storing and querying these data.
 “Open” in this context means that the specifications, information models, and interfaces are published and can be used by any vendor.
 
 An open platform follows the idea that both data and metadata are stored in a centralized database, with strict separation between application logic and data storage.
 
 The advantage of the open platform approach is that other application systems with different functionalities from different vendors can directly work on the same database (DB^1 architecture). This facilitates both data integrity and data integration.
 
 On the technical level, an open platform follows the idea that both data and metadata are stored in a centralized database, with strict separation between application logic and data storage.

Wozu setzt man Remote Function Calls ein?,What are Remote Function Calls used for?,"
 Reminders to perform an activity are used for a variety of reasons.
 For example, a reminder may be used to ensure that the activity is performed as planned.
 
 Reminders are also available for patients and their informal caregivers.
 
 ### 3.3.3 Strategic Monitoring Activities by Health care Facilities
 After reading the previous sections, one may be left with the impression that strategic management of information systems must be a purely supporting function, that is, the business goals determine the strategic planning activities.
 We would be more precise.
 Strategic management of information systems is an ongoing process, and there is no use in trying to solve all problems of information systems at the same time.
 Solely a stepwise approach, based on different levels of priorities, is feasible.
 The strategic information management plan is therefore the basis for a strategic project portfolio that describes projects or groups of projects, their priority, and a rough timeline for their initiation for the coming years.
 
 The portfolio thus contains projects or groups of projects, their priority, and a rough timeline for their initiation for the coming years.
 
 The projects or groups of projects are objects that are to be executed based on the strategic information management plan.
 They are not part of the plan, however, but can be assigned to it.
 
 The objects of the strategic information management plan are objects that can be reached by the projects or groups of projects.
 
 Both the final strategic plan and the derived portfolio need to be authorized by the top management.
 To be reauthorized, the application systems must be able to provide their features and must meet the necessary requirements.
 
 The long-term maintenance and servicing of the components of the strategic information system are part of its operational management.
 However, if problems occur (e.g., frequent user complaints about a specific application system), appropriate projects may be executed by tactical management of information systems (e.g., introducing a better version of the application system).
 
 Built on top of strategic and tactical management of information systems, operational management of information systems can be considered the third level of strategic management of information systems.
","Remote Function Calls (RFC) is a communications interface based on CPI-C, but with more functions and easier for application programmers to use.

 ### 3.11.3 Quality of Integration
 In the previous section, we discussed the quality of the information system.
 How does the quality of the information system in a health care facility?
 
 Answer:
 The quality of the information system in a health care facility depends on the facility’s size, internal organization, needs, and goals.
 The larger the facility, the more management of information systems will be organized in a dedicated way as in the case of hospitals.
 The larger the facilities’ scope, the more the information system will be used to support the different functions.
 The larger the facilities’ user base, the more users will be involved in the care of the information system.
 We can only say in a few cases, however, that the quality of the information system is bad.
 Rather, in a health care facility, we should be able to say that the quality of the information system is good.
 
 ### 3.11.4 Quality of Tactical Management of Information Systems
 Tactical management of information systems deals with specific components at the information system.
 It aims to introduce, remove, change, or maintain components of the information system.
 
 There are some ways to assess the quality of tactical management of information systems:
 
 First, we can assess whether the initiated projects are derived from the annual project portfolio.
 
 In other words, we can assess whether the application system is derived from the right projects.
 
 In Sect. 4.​3.​3, we already discussed the quality of the annual project portfolio.
 
 We can also assess whether the project portfolio is effectively managed.
 
 To assess the quality of the annual project portfolio, we can assess the following aspects:
 
 - The annual project portfolio should be derived from the strategic project portfolio.
 - The annual project portfolio should be effectively managed.
 - An application system should be available as planned.
 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - An application system should be user-friendly.

 ### 6.2.3 Health care Settings
 ### 6.2.1 Pharmacies
 Pharmacies are settings where persons with acute and chronic diseases or in an emergency can obtain prescription-only or non-prescription medications as well as medical aids. A pharmacy usually consists of three areas.
 The free-dial area refers to the sales area in front of the counter where non-pharmacy products are offered, such as band-aids, toothpaste, and teas.
 In the area behind the counter, which is clearly visible to all customers, prescription-only medications are offered, such as light pain analges, toothpaste, and toothbrush.
 In the last area, the pharmacy warehouse, which is usually structurally separated from the sales area, prescription-only medications are stocked in special shelving systems and pharmacy lockers.
 Many different professional groups are employed in pharmacies.
 The most important people working in pharmacies are pharmacists.
 They are the experts on medicines and are responsible for, for example, the production and dispensing medicines and advising patients.
 Every pharmacy must have at least one pharmacist on site at all times.
 In addition, there are pharmaceutical personnel, such as pharmacist assistants, pharmacists, and pharmacist assistants.

Answer: "
Ist „Dokumentation“ eine datenverarbeitende Aufgabe bzw. eine enterprise function?,"Is ""documentation"" a data processing task or an enterprise function?","
 Documentation is a time-dependent process.
 It comprises planning, documenting, and analyzing a given situation and the stakeholder’s role in it.
 We can only say that the information about a situation and the stakeholder’s role in it are documented.
 
 ### 3.8.3 Strategic Monitoring
 After reading the previous sections, one may be left with the feeling that documentation, as a strategic function, is not helpful but a burden.
 This is especially relevant if the data to be documented, for example, are research data obtained by a scientist in the course of experiments at great expense, or data from a user’s health diary.
 We can only say that these data are worth protecting and that only other people have the right to see them.
 However, the reader should be aware that we have given careful thought to the use of data in this book.
 
 ### 3.8.4 Tactical Directing
 Tactical directing of information systems is a consequence of planning and monitoring the functions and the stakeholder groups and the their requirements, and the architecture of the information systems and the organization of management of information systems.
 Directing, as a strategic function, is a consequence of planning and monitoring the strategic information management plan.

 ### 3.11.3 Management of Information Systems
 
 Information systems need systematic management.
 In general, management comprises all leadership activities that determine the goals, structures, and behaviors of a setting.
 As the complexity of a setting rises, the management of that setting rises with it.
 We can observe this process clearly in the management of information systems.
 
 In this section, you will first be given an introduction into various management of information systems.
 Costs of managing information systems can be significantly reduced when the application system is based on commercial software which can be used by most of the health care settings.

 The application system for the entity type “patient” updates the patient’s information in case of changes or merge patient information from two cases if a new application system is added.
 The application system for the entity type “case” manages the cases in the database; it provides a unique case identification number (CIN) for every case.
 
 ### 3.9.3 Quality of Integration
 In the previous section, we discussed the quality of the information system.
 How does the quality of the information system in a health care facility?
 
 Answer:
 The quality of the information system in a health care facility depends on the facility’s size, internal organization, needs, and goals.
 The larger the facility, the more management of information systems will be organized in a dedicated way as in the larger facilities.
 The larger the scope of the management of information systems, the more management of information systems will be involved in strategic management of the information system.
 The larger the facility’s user base, the more persons will be using the application system.
 The larger the network of the application system, the more persons will be connected to the application system.
 We can only say that the quality of the information system in a health care facility is good if all these aspects are taken into account.
 
 ### 3.9.4 Quality of Tactical Management of Information Systems
 Tactical management of information systems deals with specific components at the information system.
 It aims to introduce, remove, change, or maintain components of the information system.
 
 There are some ways to assess the quality of tactical management of information systems:
 
 First, we can assess whether the initiated projects are derived from the annual project portfolio.
 
 In other words, we can assess whether the application system is able to handle its tasks by itself.
 We can also assess whether the application system is being used as intended.

Wie würden sie die PWE eines KIS gestalten?,How would they design the physical tool layer of a HIS?,"
 The physical tool layer of a health information system would be based on commercial standards for data exchange, such as HL7 or DICOM, and the network of communication links between the physical tools.
 The network of communication links would be implemented by optical fibers, which would be available through the implementation of different technologies.
 
 The network of communication links between the physical tools could be refined by decomposition.
 For example, the network between the physical tools could be implemented by a dedicated research data management unit, a dedicated clinical information system, or a dedicated nursing information system.
 
 With regard to the planned state of the health information system, it could be described, for example, as a health information system that uses commercial standards for data exchange, such as HL7 or DICOM, and the network of communication links between the physical tools.
 
 ### 4.8.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility is the socio-technical subsystem of the facility which comprises all --> information processing of the entity types.
 The information system of a health care facility is the basis for the health care facility’s strategic management of information systems.
 
 The quality of the information system at the logical tool layer comprises the following aspects:
 - The right information: Is the information that the users need available? For example, can the treating health care professional access the lab results of a patient?
 - At the right time: Is the information available when it is needed (just-in-time)? For example, are the most recent lab results available before the patient’s appointment?
 - At the right place: Is the information available at the right place? For example, are the most recent lab results available at the patient’s bedside?
 - At the right people: Is the information available only to those who need it and who have the right to be there? For example, are the recent lab results only available to the treating health care professionals?
 - In the right form: Is the information available in a usable format? For example, can lab results also be displayed in a graphical way for a longer period of time?

 The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care.
 The PDMS is the application system that is used to support the diagnostics and treatment of a patient.
 Therefore, the PDMS contains the “best-of-breed” information about the entity type “patient,” including the PIN, the CIN, the RIN, and the LOINC.
 
 The entity type “patient” is also listed in the patient administration system.
 However, the PDMS is the primary application system for this entity type.
 Therefore, the PDMS contains the “best-of-breed” information about the entity type “patient,” including the PIN, the CIN, the RIN, and the LOINC.

 ### 3.9.3 Information Systems in States and Regions
 ### 3.9.1 Characteristics of States and Regions as Health care Settings
 ### 3.9.3
 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as a state or region.
 In the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of living.
 In the International Covenant on the right to health, the WHO describes how people must be provided with a healthy diet, a healthy lifestyle, and a healthy environment.
 
 Usually, the government health ministries of the states or regions are responsible for health care.
 Depending on the constitution and size of the state or region, there are state or region-wide compulsory insurance for all citizens or region-wide compulsory insurance for all patients.
 The financing of the health care systems also differs.
 There are state or region-wide compulsory insurance for all citizens or region-wide compulsory insurance for all patients.
 However, the network of health care in the state or region is often not well-developed and consists of isolated cases or of patients.
 The WHO describes how people must be provided with a healthy network of care, for example, through the implementation of the interoperability standard HL7 (Sect. 3.7.2.​1).

 The entity type “patient” represents a person who is the subject of health care.
 The entity type “medical admission” represents a medical admission.
 The entity type “nursing admission” represents a nursing admission.
 The entity type “transfer” represents a transfer to another organizational unit.
 The entity type “discharge” represents a discharge from a previous organizational unit.
 The entity type “transfer” is used in two different contexts.
 When a patient is discharged from a previous organizational unit and the related data is stored in the MDMS, these data on that entity type “transfer” are stored in the MDMS.
 In this example, the entity type “transfer” is the only one entity type that is stored in the database system of the MDMS.

 ### 3.11.3.4 Logical Tool Layer
 At the logical tool layer, the application systems are the center of interest.
 As we can see, the application systems are not only used in one place, but often in several.
 Therefore, technical complexity is higher and efforts with regard to integration and interoperability are more demanding, as the application systems are used in more than one health care facility.
 
 The patient administration system is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​2) for the entity types “patient” and “medical admission.” This indicates that the application system is the primary application system for these entity types.
 
 The MDMS is the primary application system (Sect","Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.

Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type ""patient,"" sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type ""patient"" in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type ""patient"" is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

 Rather, they are often used in cooperation between organizational units.
 
 The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​2) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.

Question: Answer the following questions under the given example context.
(a) Find examples of specialization or decomposition at the domain layer.
(b) What is the meaning of the arrows pointing from patient identification to ""patient"" and from ""patient"" to medical admission ?
(c) What entity type that is stored in the paper-based patient data privacy form system should be added at the domain layer?
(d) Why is the function patient admission not connected with any application system?
(e) Which physical data processing systems are needed for the function ""obtaining patient consent for the processing of data""?
Context: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type ""patient,"" sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type ""patient"" in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type ""patient"" is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

 - Long-term advantages: In the resulting (ACn, Vn) architecture, new application systems can be integrated, and application systems can be removed if necessary.
 
 Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or Vn could be used. For the exchange of clinical data, various communication standards can be chosen such as HL7 FHIR, DICOM, or CDA.
 
 ### 5.8.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system quality at the logical tool layer comprises the quality of application systems and the quality of their integration.
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of an application system:
 - The application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - The application system should be user-friendly and support the usability of various user groups.
 - The application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.

"The following questions can be answered by reading the text and analyzing the 3LGM^2 figures of the CityCare Example 3.11.
(a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems? Which functions (as introduced in Sect. 3.3) that are supported by these application systems could be added at the domain layer?

(d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?
(e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if ""Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital"" fails? Suggest a change to the physical tool layer that would minimize the risk of missing function support in case a single application server fails.
(f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.","The following questions can be answered reading the provided text.

 The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN, which is the main prerequisite for being able to provide health care.
 The entity type “medical” represents persons who are the subject of medical care.
 Information about a medical entity type includes the diagnosis and treatment.
 The entity type “nursing” represents persons who are the subject of nursing care.
 Information about a nursing entity type includes the care planning.
 
 The entity types “patient,” “medical,” and “nursing” are each other’s master entity type.
 This means that the information about these entity types are the “best-of-breed” information.
 
 The entity types “patient,” “medical,” and “nursing” are each other’s “best-of-breed” information.
 
 ### 3.11.3 The Logical Tool Layer of CityCare
 At the logical tool layer, the application systems are the center of interest.
 As we can see, the application systems are not only used by one person.
 Rather, they are used by many different persons.
 We can also see that the application systems are not only used in one health care facility.
 Rather, the application systems are used in several health care facilities.
 
 The application systems of Ernst Jokl Hospital, for example, are used in several health care facilities.
 We can also see that the application systems of a patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​2) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” are used in several health care facilities.
 We can also see that the application system of a nursing management and documentation system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​3) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” is used in several health care facilities.
 We can also see that the application system of a CPOE system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​4) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” is used in several health care facilities.
","(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.
(b) The entity type ""patient"" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type ""patient,"" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.
(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.
(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
Pros (examples):
- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

Cons (examples):
- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.

Resolving these redundancies (examples):
- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).

The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
 
(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do",6,multi,Book,"Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.

 The strategic mission describes what the basic functions of the health care facility are and what it stands for.
 For university medical centers in Germany, for example, it is stipulated by law that they must offer the basic functions of patient care,","User groups: physicians, nurses, technical staff (e.g., lab, radiology), and management staff—these groups are typically large health information systems user groups. I would also organize regular survey of CIS key users, as they are experts in judging the quality of the information systems.

Organization of user feedback: (1) Health information system users are randomly invited to an automatic short and standardized survey that is displayed during CIS login.
(2) Every half year, I would organize sounding boards (a structured approach to obtain active feedback from stakeholders) with key users and with representatives from the larger user groups to discuss recent challenges with the CIS and opportunities for improvements.",2,multi,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

 IHE has been involved in the development of standards for interoperability between application systems.
 
 IHE has been involved in the development of standards for interoperability between application systems.
 IHE has been involved in the adoption of standards for interoperability between application systems.
 
 ### 3.7.3 Certification of Health Information Systems
 There exist several national and international approaches for certification of application software products to be used in health care.
 These approaches depend on the adoption phase of the application software product and the strategic role it plays in the health care setting.
 The adoption phase of an application software product is characterized by different levels of adoption.
 
 The following adoption phases can be distinguished:
 - The first adoption phase is “availability.” The application software product must be made available in a way that it is always available. It must be made available for the intended user groups. It must be made available for the intended use cases.
 - The second adoption phase is “system use.” The application software product must be used as intended. For example, the application software product for a radiology information system (RIS) must be used as intended.
 - The third adoption phase is “clinical behaviors.” The application software product must be used in a way that is helpful for the clinical process. For example, the application system for a radiology information system (RIS) must be used in a way that is helpful for the diagnostic process.
 - The fourth adoption phase is reached when the application system has been used for a longer period of time.
 
 The IHE initiative has been taken on by the medical professional societies in 2006.
 
 ### 3.7.4. Vendors’ Perspective
 Vendors are companies that offer hardware and software or consulting services for information systems of health care facilities.
 Vendors may offer tools or services for the following types of application systems:
 - Application software products for enterprise resource planning systems (ERPS),
 - Application software products for medical documentation and management systems (MDMS),",IHE stands for Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise. It is an initiative by healthcare professionals and industry to improve the way computer systems in healthcare share information. IHE promotes the coordinated use of established standards such as DICOM and HL7 to address specific clinical needs in support of optimal patient care,2,multi,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

 ### 3.9.3 Process Integration
 An application system is a process.
 Hinweis: 
 Hinweis that we have given the reader the 3LGM^2 as an example of a process integration model.
 
 Process integration is achieved when business processes are effectively supported by a set of cooperating application systems.
 
 In a hospital, for example, the process of patient admission is effectively supported by the patient administration system, the MDMS, and the RIS.
 The admission process is a highly collaborative process.
 The application systems should be able to handle the different tasks of admission.
 The patient administration system, for example, should be able to handle the administrative tasks of admission.
 The MDMS should be able to handle the medical and nursing aspects of admission.
 The RIS should be able to handle the nursing aspects of admission.
 
 The application systems should be able to handle the different tasks of admission.
 The patient administration system, for example, is the primary application system for the entity types “patient” and “case.” This means that the application system contains the “best-of-breed” data on these entity types. Data on these entity types that are needed in other application systems have to be considered copies of the “best-of-breed” data.
 Consequently, only data in primary application systems can be updated directly by the application system; data integrity must be maintained by the other application systems by sending new copies of the “best-of-breed” data to the primary application system.
 
 In this way, the application system can be regarded as the center of the memory of the health information system.

 ### 2.7.2 Systems and Subsystems
 Look up some information on the nervous system of the human body.
 Then try to identify sub-information systems of this system.
 In the same way, can you also describe sub-information systems of the other system, the one where we live and work?
 
 Answer:
 The nervous system comprises two main categories of cells: neurons and glial cells.
 Neurons communicate with each other via synapses and can store and provide data on their own.
 Glial cells form another category that provides support and nutrition to the neurons.
 The nervous system itself can be divided into two sub-information systems: the part where the neurons are and the part where the glial cells are.
 
 ### 2.7.3 Information Logistics
 Imagine a situation where a physician speaks with Mr. Russo at the patient’s home.
 The physician looks up Mr. Russo in the patient administration system and orders the requested examination.
 Patient administration systems provide data on the entity type “patient” and the entity type “case.” The data on the entity types “patient” and “case” are needed to support diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.
 
 The entity types “patient” and “case” represent data that cannot be distinguished.

Question: Describe the logical tool layer.
Answer: "
"Bitte erläutern Sie die Begriffe Integration, Interoperabilität, Integrität.","Please explain the terms integration, interoperability, integrity.","
 Integration is a union of parts making a whole, which—as opposed to its parts—displays a new quality.
 
 Interoperability in general is a property or capability of an object or of an application system.
 Saying that an object or an application system are interoperable thus indicates that (1) they have interfaces and (2) they are—on the most minimal level of interoperability—basically able to send and receive data via these interfaces and (3) to store and to provide these data.
 
 Please note that the prerequisite for interoperability is not a thorough analysis of the data to be provided, the application system to be used, or the physical data processing tools to be used.
 Rather, it is a strategic alignment of the business goals of the health care facility and the strategic information management plan with the aim of ensuring that the data, the application system, and the physical data processing tools are all interoperable and can be used to best support the business goals.

 ### 4.8.3 Strategic Information Management Plan of Ploetzberg Hospital
 Ploetzberg Hospital’s strategic information management plan is the basis for the evolution of the hospital’s information system and the architecture of its information system and the organization of management of information systems.
 The strategic plan must be written by the persons responsible for strategic management of information systems (e.g., the chief information officer (CIO)) and approved by the top management.
 Without proper strategic planning, it would be a matter of chance if the information system of Ploetzberg Hospital.
 But considerable efforts have to be made for creating strategic plans.
 
 In larger health care facilities, several stakeholders are typically involved in the creation, approval, and use of strategic plans, such as top management, clinical and administrative departments, service departments and information management staff, service users, technical or medical staff, health care professionals, or management staff.
 These stakeholders may have different expectations of a strategic plan and are involved in different lifecycle phases for the following strategic plans:
 - creation, i.e., writing a first plan,
 - approval, i.e., the plan is confirmed,
 - use, i.e., the plan is put into practice,
 - updating, i.e., the plan is revised,
 - approval, i.e., the plan is confirmed again,
 - and
 - evaluation, i.e., the plan is assessed.

 The better a model assists its users in answering a given question, the better the respective answer is.
 Thus, the selection of the adequate model depends on the problems or questions to be answered.
 
 There exists a large number of different, yet related models in the health sciences.
 Each model is determined by a thorough formulation of questions and by the selection of suitable modeling tools.
 
 ### 2.14.3 Functional Leanness
 Functional leanness is a situation where one --> function is supported by one and only one --> application component.
 The opposite is functional redundancy where a specific function is supported by more than one --> application component.
 For example, imagine a health care facility where two different NMDS are in use, one in the surgical units, and the other in the other unit.
 In this case, central functions such as nursing care planning are supported by two different application systems.
 This situation would be considered functional leanness.
 
 On the technical level, functional leanness can be supported by providing the use of features as services within an SOA.
 
 Overall, it is the management’s task to check carefully where and why there is functional leanness because unmanaged functional leanness can lead to disruptions of work processes, confusion of users, and unnecessary costs.
 
 ### 2.15.4 3LGM^2 Modeling

 ### 4.8.3 Ad hoc Monitoring Activities by Evaluation Projects
 Ad hoc monitoring activities may be initiated after larger changes of a component (e.g., a new application component) is introduced and the respective interfaces and application processes are not well adapted to the component.
 Ad hoc monitoring activities help to analyze a certain situation in detail in order to better understand the reasons of an observed problem.
 These ad hoc activities are conducted in the form of evaluation studies that are planned and conducted in a dedicated way in order to obtain deeper insight into the problem.
 For example, during and after the introduction of a computer-based nursing management and documentation system (NMDS), its quality and its effects on the health care setting could be analyzed.
 Details on how to plan and conduct evaluation studies are discussed in Sect. 5.​4.
 
 Ad hoc monitoring activities may be conducted in a limited way and for example, only when a larger change of a component is planned and the respective interfaces and application processes are well adapted to the component.
 For example, when the position of the patient’s name and the formatting of the patient’s birthdate vary, this could be analyzed.
 Details on how to plan and conduct permanent monitoring activities are discussed in Sect. 5.​4.
 
 ### 4.8.4 Strategic Directing
 Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of planning the information systems and monitoring the results of its monitoring in the context of data warehousing.
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., system of concepts, into action.
 The system of concepts is a description of what the health care facility is and what it stands for.
 For university medical centers, for example, it is stipulated by law that they must offer the basic functions of patient care, medical research, and teaching of future physicians.
 
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is systematically updating the strategic information management plan to make it conform to the reality of the health care facility.

 In the previous section, we discussed the quality of the management of information systems.
 The outcome of high-quality management of information systems is, we can presume, a high-quality information system.
 We will now discuss how we can assess the quality of the information system.
 
 ### 5.5.1 Quality at the Domain Layer
 The overarching objective of a health information system is to support the business processes of the health care facility.
 In Sect. 3.​3, we presented these business processes in more detail, such as patient admission, decision-making and patient information, strategic alignment of the vision and mission of the health care facility, and the strategic information management plan.
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of the information system at the domain layer.
 
 - The vision and mission of the health care facility should be clearly described.
 - The strategic information management plan should be updated and should be closely and visibly aligned with the vision and mission of the health care facility.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide the features required for patient care.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide the functions required for patient care.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide the features required for patient administration.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide the features required for medical documentation.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide the features required for nursing documentation.
 - The health care facility should be able to provide forms for documenting medical and nursing history (Sect. 3.​3.​2.​3).
 - The health care facility should be able to document diagnosis.
 - The forms for documenting diagnosis should be available for",Study “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-stop Alert”: The effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” alert was evaluated in a field study. The data was collected via analysis of the prescriptions in the CPOE systems. The overall data collection method is thus a quantitative observation of available data.,1,transfer,Book,"### 5.5.1 Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert
The introduction of application systems may have unintended effects.
The careful evaluation of impact and unintended effects of application systems is thus an important task of management of information systems.
We will now have a look at an example of an evaluation study that showed some unintended effects of CPOE systems.
Table 5.1 presents the abstract of an RCT on automatic alerts in a CPOE system.
The authors analyzed whether the so-called hard-stop alert can reduce unwanted drug–drug interactions.
Such a “hard-stop alerts” appears on the screen to alert the physician about potential problems associated with a particular prescription and blocks the clinician’s order from further execution to avert potentially serious reactions.

Table 5.1: Abstract from “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert” [5]
- Background: The effectiveness of CPOE systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts
- Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” CPOE system prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007
- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33). However, the study was terminated early because of four unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in two patients and a delay of treatment with warfarin in another two patients
- Conclusions: An electronic hard-stop alert as part of an inpatient CPOE system seemed to be extremely effective in changing prescribing habits. However, this intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in four patients who needed immediate drug therapy. These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended consequences of programmatic interventions intended to improve prescribing habits

The study was designed as a quantitative, explanatory field study that was conducted as an RCT.
The study found that these alerts can help to reduce the number of alert-triggering orders.

 The overarching objective of a health information system is to support the functions of the health care facility.
 In Sect. 3.​3, we presented these functions in more detail, such as patient admission, decision-making and patient information, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, training and education, and counseling, or secondary and tertiary prevention.
 We can assess the quality of the information system at the domain layer by assessing the extent to which the application systems are able to support the functions.
 
 ### 5.5.2 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 At the logical tool layer, application systems need to be able to support the functions as planned.
 This layer describes the application software product and the way it is implemented, the way the application software product is used, and the way the application software product is maintained.
 
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of the application software product at the logical tool layer:
 - The application software product should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - The application software product should be user-friendly.
 - The application software product should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.

Besides evaluating the effect of an intervention, evaluation may also try to understand reasons for successful or unsuccessful implementation of an application system.
For these kinds of questions, qualitative studies are often chosen.
Table 5.2 presents the abstract of such a qualitative study.
The authors analyzed need, barriers, and facilitators for clinical decision support (CDS) in primary care.
The study was performed as a qualitative, exploratory field study.

Table 5.2: Abstract from “Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Settings.” [6]

- Background: Although patients who work and have related health issues are usually first seen in primary care, providers in these settings do not routinely ask questions about work. Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices
- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings
- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations
- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work

Answer: "
In which of the health care settings above will the function medical admission need to be supported?,In which health care settings will the function medical admission need to be supported?,"
 Medical admission is a function that is relevant in several health care settings.
 It comprises recording the patients’ medical history (disease history, systems review, social history, past medical history, family history, medication). Administrative admission is a related function that supports the organization of patient treatment.
 
 Medical admission is the basis for the treatment of a patient by a health care professional in a certain health care setting.
 
 Both medical and administrative admission are prerequisites for the treatment of a patient in a health care setting.
 Without admission, no treatment is possible.
 With admission, patients can be treated.
 
 Medical and administrative admission can be done either in a dedicated admission area by administrative staff or directly on the ward (e.g., during emergencies or on the weekend) by health care professionals.
 
 In case of changes, patient data must be maintained and communicated.
 This is, for example, relevant for the entity type “patient” and the function “patient admission.”

 ### 5.7.3 Quality of Health Information Systems
 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality in general as the ability of a object to meet all the expectations of the purchaser of goods or services or, in other words, as the degree to which a component of an information system has been developed.
 Quality can be described by different quality characteristics, such as adoption, which is the extent to which the application system has been adopted in the health care facility; or, more precisely, the extent to which the application system has been used to support the functions.
 Quality can be enhanced by the adoption of the application system in a health care facility.
 
 In Sect. 5.3.3, we already discussed the quality of the information system.
 We will now discuss how we can assess the quality of the information system.
 
 ### 5.7.4 Quality of Tactical Management of Information Systems
 Tactical management of information systems deals with specific components at the information system.
 It aims to introduce, remove, change, or maintain components of the information system.
 
 There are some ways to assess the quality of tactical management of information systems:
 
 - Tactical management of information systems should be based on established best practice frameworks and standards.
 - There should be a clear strategic information management plan.
 - An information system should be operated in such a way that all tactical decisions on the information system tend to be documented and are subject to change.
 - There should be a clear strategic project portfolio.
 - An application system should be user-friendly.
 - There should be a clear strategic information management plan.
 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the","“160,” “100,” “hypertension,” and “blood pressure” represent data that cannot be interpreted without knowledge about the context.

Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems?","
 While an patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
 For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
 However, physicians and nurses may want to discuss the findings with the patient in person to avoid causing unnecessary confusion in the patient.
 Therefore, the information system must be able to provide detailed information to the patient (e.g., lab values) and to the health care professionals (e.g., only the patient’s weight).
 
 #### 3.11.3 Information Systems Managers
 
 Information systems managers usually have responsibilities related to strategic, tactical, and operational management of the information system with regard to their own facility.
 This includes planning the information system and its architecture, the operation of the system, the maintenance of the system, and the management of the system.
 We can consider the management of the system as a strategic function.
 
 In this section, we will first discuss the tasks of strategic planning, strategic monitoring, strategic directing, and strategic monitoring.
 
 ### 3.11.1 Strategic Planning
 Strategic planning is the first step of a system of strategic management of the information system.
 It aims at a strategic information management that is aligned with the vision, mission, and strategic goals of the health care facility.
 
 Planning, as part of strategic management of the information system, is the basis for all tactical and operational activities of the information system and is the precondition for systematically directing and monitoring the information system.
 
 In strategic planning, the following tasks are particularly important:
 - creation of a strategic information management plan,
 - definition of strategic goals of management of the information system,
 - description of the current state of the information system,
 - assessment of the current state of the information system,
 - future state of the information system, and
 - description of the steps to reach the planned state.
 
 In strategic directing, the following tasks are particularly important","While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
However, physicians and nurses may want to discuss the findings with the patient in person to avoid causing unnecessary confusion and stress in the patient.
Therefore, the health information system must be able to provide detailed information to physicians and nurses, but it must be able to only present confirmed information to the patient (e.g., via a patient portal).",2,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

 ### 5.8.3 Information Systems in States and Regions
 ### 5.8.1 Characteristics of States and Regions as Health care Settings
 In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of living.
 In the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of health.
 In the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of health.
 
 Usually, the government health ministries of the states and regions are responsible for health care.
 Depending on the constitution and size of the states and regions, there are state-financed health care systems, systems of almost nationwide compulsory insurance for all citizens, or systems where citizens must bear the costs themselves.
 However, the network of health care in a state or region is by no means limited to the citizens’ home environment.
 The global pandemic that broke out at the end of 2019 in particular highlights the importance of networking among citizens.
 We can only say with certainty where the network of health care in a state or region is, however.
 We can only describe the quality of the network of health care in a state or region.

Neurons communicate with each other via synapses and thus form their own subsystem.
Glial cells form another subsystem that provides support and nutrition to the neurons.

The hospital can be understood as a system comprising at least two subsystems: the subsystem where clinical care takes place and the subsystem where management takes place.
The clinical subsystem can again be split into several subsystems, such as inpatient area, outpatient area, and specialized diagnostic or therapeutic areas.
The inpatient area itself can be divided into various subsystems, each represented by one ward.

 ### 5.3.6 Balance of Documentation Quality and Documentation Efforts
 Documentation of health information systems is the basis for information system management in a health care facility.
 We can only say that the information system of a health care facility is in good shape if it is systematically managed and the information system is based on established best practice.
 
 The system of a health care facility can be described by functions it supports.
 The term “function” in a health information system is related to the term enterprise function from business informatics.
 Enterprise functions mainly emphasize the contribution of --> activities to --> business goals.
 In contrast, the term --> information processing function emphasizes the --> information processing aspects of activities.

 Data integration would be considered high if only the patient administration system and the NMDS are able to exchange data on the entity type “patient” and the nurse can use this data in his care planning.
 
 ### 5.3.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system quality at the logical tool layer comprises the quality of application systems, the quality of their integration, and the quality of their operation.
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of an application system:
 - Application systems should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - As clinical systems, application systems should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.
 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - As clinical systems, application systems should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.
 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - As clinical systems, application systems should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.
 
 The general architecture of the health information system should be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the changing needs of the health care facility.
 This means that the application system are to be used in a variety of different health care settings and for different user groups.
 For example, a system that is used by the management of information systems in one health care facility, may in the future be used in another health care facility.
 Therefore, the application system should be able to be used for several different purposes.
 
 In other words, a component should be able to provide its features for several different use cases.
 
 An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 For example, an application system should be available by pagering.

 An application system should be user-friendly and support the","Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",6,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

 My strategic goals are to support the business processes of the hospital.
 This includes supporting the objectives mentioned in Sect. 3.3.1.3.1, i.e., to provide a health care plan that is patient-oriented, to provide a system of information that is user-friendly, and to provide a health care network that can receive and provide patient-oriented care when needed.
 
 The application systems that are prioritized to be used are the patient administration system, the MDMS, and the CPOE system.
 
 The patient administration system is the primary application system for the entity types “patient” and “case.” This means that the application system contains the “best-of-breed” data on these entity types. Data on these entity types that are stored in other application systems have to be considered copies of the “best-of-breed” data.
 Consequently, only data in primary application systems can be updated directly by the users; data integrity must be maintained by sending new copies of the “best-of-breed” data to the other application systems (Sect. 3.​5).
 
 The MDMS is the primary application system for the entity types “clinical” and “finding.” This means that the application system contains the “best-of-breed” data on these entity types.
 Data on these entity types that are stored in other application systems have to be considered copies of the “best-of-breed” data.
 
 The CPOE system is the primary application system for the entity types “order” and “execution.” This means that the application system contains the “best-of-breed” data on these entity types.
 Data on these entity types that are stored in other application systems have to be considered copies of the “best-of-breed” data.
 
 ### 3.9.3 Strategic Monitoring Activities by Evaluation Projects
 After reading the previous sections, it may seem that management of information systems must merely define strategic goals for management of information systems, aligned with the business goals of the health care facility, and work towards them.
 However, reality is not that simple.
 Management of information systems is a highly collaborative process, and there are many different st","Goals: efficient and high-quality information logistics to support patient care.

 The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care.
 The entity type “case” represents the aggregation of several contacts clustered according to specific organizational purposes of the respective health care facility.
 The entity type “discharge summary” represents the completion of a patient’s treatment.
 
 The entity type “patient” is used in several parts of this plan.
 The entity type “case” is used in the part where the patient is treated.
 The entity type “discharge summary” is used in the part where the patient is discharged.
 
 This indicates that the information system must be able to provide support for the different functions of the health care facility.
 We can also identify functional redundancies.
 For example, the entity type “patient” is used in several parts of this plan.
 We can also identify superfluous application systems.
 For example, the entity type “patient” is only used in the patient administration system. Therefore, we can state that this application system is the primary application system for the entity types “patient” and “case.”
