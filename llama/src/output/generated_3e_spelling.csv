One entity type that is used and updated by this function is “patient.” The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on.",6,multi,Book,"Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer.

 User interface Integration: Cond","Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",6,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.
