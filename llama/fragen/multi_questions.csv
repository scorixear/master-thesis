"Consider the requirements of various stakeholders when it comes to health information systems supporting various life situations.
Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems?
";Consider the requirements of various stakeholders when it comes to health information systems supporting various life situations. The following situation leads to contradiciton of difference between requirements of two stake holders. This will also have impliciations on building health information systems as explained now.\n Situation:;"While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
However, physicians and nurses may want to discuss the findings with the patient in person to avoid causing unnecessary confusion and stress in the patient.
Therefore, the health information system must be able to provide detailed information to physicians and nurses, but it must be able to only present confirmed information to the patient (e.g., via a patient portal).";2;Book;
"Look up some information on the nervous system of the human body.

In the same way, can you also describe subsystems of the system “hospital”?";"Whe comparing the nervous system of the humand body to the system ""hospital"" the following subsystems can be identified and described:\n";"The nervous system comprises two main categories of cells: neurons and glial cells.
Neurons communicate with each other via synapses and thus form their own subsystem.
Glial cells form another subsystem that provides support and nutrition to the neurons.

The hospital can be understood as a system comprising at least two subsystems: the subsystem where clinical care takes place and the subsystem where management takes place.
The clinical subsystem can again be split into several subsystems, such as inpatient area, outpatient area, and specialized diagnostic or therapeutic areas.
The inpatient area itself can be divided into various subsystems, each represented by one ward.

"Look at the 3LGM^2 example in Sect. 2.15.
Use this example to explain the meaning of the following elements: functions, entity types, application systems, non-computer-based application components, physical data processing system, and inter-layer relationships.";;"Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.
One entity type that is used and updated by this function is “patient.” The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on.
";6;Book;"Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM^2 classes.

"Look at the 3LGM^2 sample model in Sect. 2.15 and try to answer the following questions.
(a) Find examples of specialization or decomposition at the domain layer.
(b) What is the meaning of the arrows pointing from patient identification to “patient” and from “patient” to medical admission ?
(c) What entity type that is stored in the paper-based patient data privacy form system should be added at the domain layer?
(d) Why is the function patient admission not connected with any application system?
(e) Which physical data processing systems are needed for the function “obtaining patient consent for the processing of data”?";;"(a) The function “patient admission” is decomposed into five subfunctions—patient admission is only complete if all the subfunctions are completed. The entity type “patient” is decomposed into four entity types—data regarding that entity type are only complete if data about all sub-entity types is complete. There are no examples of specialization at the domain layer of Fig. 2.11.

(b) The function “patient identification” updates the entity type “patient.” The function “medical admission” uses the entity type “patient.” This indicates that identifying patient data are updated or created during patient admission and then used for medical admission.
 
(c) The entity type “privacy statement” could be added at the domain layer. It would be updated by the function “obtaining consent for processing of patient data.”
 
(d) Patient admission is decomposed into five subfunctions with each being linked to an application component by which it is supported. Therefore, it could lead to an ambiguous model if the superordinated function was linked with another application component. The corresponding modeling rule says that only the leaf functions in a function hierarchy should be linked to application components.

"Imagine a hospital information system that comprises four application systems: a PAS, an MDMS, a RIS, and a PDMS.
The hospital is now considering the introduction of a communication server to improve data integration.
Discuss the short-term and long-term pros and cons of this decision.
Which syntactic and semantic standards could be used?";;"Short-term advantages: The communication server can handle the communication between all four application systems, including receiving, buffering, transforming, and multicasting of messages.
It can also be used for monitoring the communication traffic.
The communication server thus supports data integration in heterogeneous information system architectures.

Long-term advantages: In the resulting (ACn, CP1) architecture, new application components can easily be integrated, as only one communication interface to the communication server needs to be implemented.

Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used as syntactic or semantic standard.
For the exchange of clinical data, various communication standards can be chosen such as HL7 FHIR, DICOM for medical images, or HL7 CDA for clinical documents.

"During a night shift, a nurse uses the patient administration system to conduct the administrative patient admission.
The nurse then uses the NMDS to plan nursing care.
Now consider the types of integration presented in Sect. 3.8 and discuss how this nurse would recognize a high (or low) level of data integration, semantic integration, user interface integration, context integration, feature integration, and process integration.
";;"Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.";6;Book;
"The following questions can be answered by reading the text and analyzing the 3LGM^2 figures of the CityCare Example 3.11.
(a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems? Which functions (as introduced in Sect. 3.3) that are supported by these application systems could be added at the domain layer?
(b) In which database systems shown in the logical tool layer should the entity type “patient” be stored?
(c) The MPI should receive messages containing PINs (entity type “patient”) from all patient administration systems. Why is there no communication link between the MPI and the patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital?
(d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?
(e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if “Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital” fails? Suggest a change to the physical tool layer that would minimize the risk of missing function support in case a single application server fails.
(f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.";;"(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.
(b) The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type “patient,” for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.
(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.
(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
Pros (examples):
- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

Cons (examples):
- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.

Resolving these redundancies (examples):
- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).

The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
 
(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems.

   1. Die administrative Patientenaufnahme erfolgt mit dem Patientenverwaltungssystem. Die administrativen Patientendaten, repräsentiert durch den Objekttyp „Patient“ werden vom Patientenverwaltungssystem über den Kommunikationsserver an das CPOE-System, das Medizinische Dokumentationssystem und das Radiologieinformationssystem gesendet. Auf Papier mitgebrachte Vorbefunde werden bei der administrativen Patientenaufnahme eingescannt und im Medizinischen Dokumentationssystem gespeichert.
   2. Ergänzen Sie je eine Aufgabe des CPOE-Systems, des Medizinischen Dokumentationssystems und des Radiologieinformationssystems (inkl. Konfigurationslinien).
