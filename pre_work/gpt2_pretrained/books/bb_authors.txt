Alfred Winter is Professor for Medical Informatics at the Institute for Medical Informatics,
Statistics, and Epidemiology of the University of Leipzig, Germany.

He studied informatics at the Technical University in Aachen, Germany, and received
his Ph.D. and a license for lecturing (German “Habilitation”) for medical informatics from
the Faculty of Theoretical Medicine at the University of Heidelberg.

His research focuses on methods and modeling tools for the management of health
information systems. He teaches information management in healthcare in a medical infor-
matics masters course at Leipzig University and in master programs for health care man-
agement and for health information management at the private Dresden International
University in Dresden. He works as a consultant and is responsible for coordinated strate-
gic information management at Leipzig University Hospital and Leipzig University
Medical Faculty. He is member of the board of the German professional association of
medical informaticians (BVMI), member of the board of the joint medical informatics
division of the German Association of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology
(GMDS) and the German Association of Informatics (GI) and chair of their working group
“Methods and tools for the management of hospital information systems.”

Reinhold Haux is Professor for Medical Informatics and Director of the Peter L. Reichertz
Institute for Medical Informatics of the University of Braunschweig — Institute of
Technology and of Hannover Medical School, Germany.

He studied Medical Informatics at the University of Heidelberg/University of Applied
Sciences Heilbronn, Germany, where he graduated as M.Sc. (German “Diplom”) in 1978.
He received a Ph.D. from the Faculty for Theoretical Medicine, University of Ulm, in 1983
and a Postdoctoral Lecture Qualification (German “Habilitation”) for Medical Informatics
and Statistics from the Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University in 1987.

His current research fields are health information systems and management and health-
enabling technologies. Since its start in 2001, the international Frank-van Swieten- Lectures
on Strategic Information Management in Hospitals are part of his teaching activities.
