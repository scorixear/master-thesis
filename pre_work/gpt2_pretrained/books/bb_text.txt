“1.1 Why Do We Need Biomedical and Health Informatics [BMHI] Education?

Despite the documented benefits, there are still barriers to HIT [health information
technology] in clinical settings, including a mismatch of return on investment
between those who pay and those who benefit, challenges to ameliorate workflow in
clinical settings, lack of standards and interoperability, and concerns about privacy
and confidentiality  .

Another barrier, lesser studied and quantified but increasingly recognized, is the lack
of characterization of the workforce and its training needed to most effectively
implement HIT systems  This has led to calls for BMHI to become a professional
discipline  and for it to acquire the attributes of a profession, such as a well-
defined set of competencies

#Foreword from the 1° Edition in 2004

Healthcare management is a complex and ever-changing task. As medical knowledge
increases, as clinical management strategies or administrative management strategies
change, and as patients move from one city to another or from one country to another, the
challenges of managing healthcare have changed and will continue to change. Central to
all of these changes is a need to store and process administrative and clinical records for
the patient. For the reasons listed above, computerization of record systems in hospitals
and clinics has been and continues to be a slow and complex process. Developing a strat-
egy to provide the best healthcare service at the lowest possible cost is a common goal of
almost every healthcare system in the world. Care given in the hospital is typically the
most advanced, the most complex, and the most expensive. As a consequence, understand-
ing and managing healthcare in hospitals is crucial to every healthcare delivery system.
This book provides a wonderful overview for students and medical informatics profession-
als. It also provides the background that every medical informatics specialist needs to
understand and manage the complexities of hospital information systems.

This book deals primarily with the underlying administrative systems that are in place
in hospitals throughout the world. These systems are fundamental to the development and
implementation of the even more challenging systems that acquire, process, and manage
the patient’s clinical information. Hospital information systems provide a major part of the
information needed by those paying for healthcare, be they hospital administrators, health
insurance companies, public health authorities, or local or national political leaders. As a
consequence an important and complex set of strategies has been implemented to docu-
ment medical problems and procedures that hospitals are dealing with. Problems are usu-
ally coded with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 or ICD-10) coding systems
while medical procedures are designated using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT)
codes. Typically, these codes are used to generate bills to an insurance company or govern-
mental unit. As a consequence, these data must be generated, transmitted, and processed
accurately and promptly. Computer technology enhances the ability of hospital clinical
and administrative staff to provide these data.#viii Foreword from the 1st Edition in 2004

Because of the complexities and changing needs of medical information, the field of
medical informatics is in need of a growing number of professionals who understand how
to use computers and are familiar with the administrative requirements of the healthcare
field and clinical medicine. Having a person who has knowledge in all of these fields is
unusual. However, I am convinced that the rate at which medicine is able to better use
computer technology is limited by the lack of a sufficient number of well-trained profes-
sionals who have an understanding of all of these fields. As a consequence, I congratulate
each of you who is studying hospital information systems and encourage you to take what
you will learn from this book and move the field forward.

After you have an understanding of what is presented in this text, I encourage you to
take on the challenge of clinical informatics. Study and learn how computers can be used
to advantage by those providing clinical care — physicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists,
and other caregivers. In the future we must all work toward developing computer and com-
munications systems that will enhance the acquisition of clinical data so that the data can
be used to provide better patient care and more efficient and better administrative
documentation.

Enjoy this book. Its clearly written materials and exercises should give every reader a
challenge and opportunity to learn. I found Appendix A, the thesaurus, a treasure of impor-
tant information. The thesaurus will be very handy for everyone for years to come. I con-
gratulate the authors for their knowledge, skillfulness, and dedication in writing and
publishing this book.

#Series Preface

This series is directed to healthcare professionals leading the transformation of healthcare
by using information and knowledge. For over 20 years, Health Informatics has offered a
broad range of titles: some address specific professions such as nursing, medicine, and
health administration; others cover special areas of practice such as trauma and radiology;
still other books in the series focus on interdisciplinary issues, such as the computer-based
patient record, electronic health records, and networked healthcare systems. Editors and
authors, eminent experts in their fields, offer their accounts of innovations in health infor-
matics. Increasingly, these accounts go beyond hardware and software to address the role
of information in influencing the transformation of healthcare delivery systems around the
world. The series also increasingly focuses on the users of the information and systems:
the organizational, behavioral, and societal changes that accompany the diffusion of infor-
mation technology in health services environments.

Developments in healthcare delivery are constant; in recent years, bioinformatics has
emerged as a new field in health informatics to support emerging and ongoing develop-
ments in molecular biology. At the same time, further evolution of the field of health
informatics is reflected in the introduction of concepts at the macro or health systems
delivery level with major national initiatives related to electronic health records (EHR),
data standards, and public health informatics.

These changes will continue to shape health services in the twenty-first century. By
making full and creative use of the technology to tame data and to transform information,
Health Informatics will foster the development and use of new knowledge in healthcare.

#Preface for the 2" Edition

In 2004, the textbook “Strategic Information Management in Hospitals — An Introduction
to Hospital Information Systems” appeared in this Health Informatics Series of Springer.
The book was received well and belongs — according to the publishing house — to the top
selling books of this series.

Five years after its appearance, both Springer and we as authors felt the need to prepare
a 2nd edition. In this 2nd edition we wanted to consider the progress in our field and also
the lessons learned from our students, when using the book in our lectures, e.g. in the
international “Frank van Swieten Lectures on Strategic Information Management in
Hospitals” (International Journal of Medical Informatics 2004; 73, 97-100 and 807-15).
Also, due to the changed perception of information systems in healthcare, which are no
longer limited to single institutions like hospitals, but can embrace several healthcare insti-
tutions within healthcare networks, this revision has become necessary.

With this book on “Health Information Systems — Architectures and Strategies” we
have prepared a substantially revised and elaborated 2nd edition.

‘What are the major differences from the 1st edition, which appeared in 2004? We
shifted the focus from hospital information systems and their strategic management to
strategic information management of health information systems. However, information
systems in hospitals still play a major role in the book. All contents have been carefully
updated. The book has been restructured in order to improve the use as a textbook for
lectures on health information systems.

In addition to the four authors of the 1st edition, two new authors (N.H., F.J.) have also
contributed to this edition. For the 2nd edition we also invited an international board of
experts — CIOs and researchers in the field of health information systems — to give us their
advice and comments, including examples and use cases.#xii Preface for the 2nd Edition

All authors have been either directly or indirectly influenced by the visionary views on
health information systems of Claus O. Kohler. Dr. Kéhler was Professor of Medical
Informatics at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany, and long-
term faculty member at the Heidelberg/Heilbronn Medical Informatics Program. His book
on the ‘integrated hospital information system’, which appeared in Germany in 1973, sig-
nificantly influenced the development of health information systems at least in Germany.
Claus passed away in 2008. We want to dedicate this book to him.

Not least, we want to thank our students, who kept asking critical questions and drew
our attention to incomplete and indistinct arguments.##Annotation to the Figures

All persons shown in the photos have given their permission. With the exception of the
Heidelberg quintuplets, no real patients are shown. The patients in the figures are mostly
the authors, their families, or medical informatics VIPs. We have partly used screen shots
from commercial software products in this book. This use cannot be regarded as a recom-
mendation for those products. We only want to illustrate typical functionality and typical
user interfaces of software products that support specific hospital functions. Therefore, we
did not mention the product names.

##Introduction

‘What is a health information system? The literature defines health information systems
(HIS) in many different ways and presents various views. Some articles focus on the orga-
nizational aspects of information processing, while others focus on the technology used.
To begin with, we understand a health information system as the information processing
and information storing subsystem of a health care organization, which may be a single
institution, for example, a hospital, or a group of health care institutions like a health care
network.

This book discusses the significance of information processing in health care, with an
emphasis on information processing in hospitals, the progress in information and commu-
nication technology, and the importance of systematic information management. Nearly
all people working in health care institutions have an enormous demand for information,
which has to be fulfilled in order to achieve high-quality and efficient patient care. For
example, physicians and nurses need information concerning the health status of patients
from different departments of their hospital. They also need current medical knowledge as
a basis for their clinical decisions. In addition, the management of a hospital needs up-to-
date information about the hospital’s costs and services. Of course, the quality of informa-
tion processing is important for the competitiveness of a hospital. Consequently, this
system of information processing can be regarded as the memory and nervous system of
the respective health care institution.

The subject of information processing is quite complex. Nearly all groups and all areas
in a health care institution depend on the quality of information processing. The amount of
information processing is tremendous. Additionally, the information needs of the different
groups are often based on the same data. Therefore, integrated information processing is
necessary. If health information systems are not systematically managed and operated,
they tend to develop chaotically. This, in turn, leads to negative consequences such as low
data quality, resulting in low quality of patient care and increasing costs. Systematic infor-
mation management can help to prevent such HIS failures and contribute to a high-quality
and efficient patient care.

Well-educated specialists in health informatics/medical informatics, with the knowl-
edge and skills to systematically manage and operate health information systems are there-
fore needed to appropriately and responsibly apply information and communication
technology to the complex information processing environment of health care settings.

This book discusses the typical architectures of health information systems and their
systematic strategic management. A lot of examples will show how certain methods and

tools can be used to describe and assess architectures of health information systems and to
support the various information management tasks in an integrated fashion.

This textbook addresses you as a health care and health/medical informatics profes-
sional as well as a student in health/medical informatics and health information manage-
ment. It should be regarded as an introduction to this complex subject. For a deeper
understanding, you will need additional knowledge and, foremost, practice in this field.

If you are not familiar with patient care and medical research, you can find an introduc-
tory chapter to health institutions and their respective information processing tasks. If you
are not familiar with information systems, you can find an introductory chapter to informa-
tion system basics.

‘We want to provide you with a terminology about health information systems which is
as complete and sound as possible. To support this, we compiled a catalog of the most
important terms as a thesaurus at the end of the book. The terms cataloged are underlined
in the text, where they are explained. If you find terms which are printed in italics, these
terms will refer to

#Health Institutions and
Information ProcessingIntroduction

Health information systems strongly influence quality and efficiency of health care, and technical
progress offers advanced opportunities to support health care. In this chapter, we will discuss the
interrelation between health information systems on one side and health care on the other side.
After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What is the significance of information systems for health care?

e How does technical progress affect health care?

eo Why is systematic information management important?Significance of Information Processing in Health care

2.2.1
Information Processing as Quality Factor

Decisions of health care professionals are based on vast amounts of information about the
patient’s health state. It is essential for the quality of patient care and for the quality of
hospital management to fulfill these information needs.

‘When a patient is admitted to a hospital, a physician or nurse first needs information
about the reason for patient admission and the patient history. Later, she or he needs results
from services such as laboratory and radiology (Fig. 2.1), which are some of the most fre-
quent diagnostic procedures. In general, clinical patient-related information should be
available on time, and it should be up-to-date and valid. For example, the recent laboratory
report should be available on the ward within 2 h after the request. If this is not the case, if
it comes too late, or is old or even wrong, quality of care and patient safety is at risk. An
incorrect laboratory report may lead to erroneous and even harmful treatment decisions.
Additionally, if examinations have to be repeated or lost findings have to be searched for,
the costs of health care may increase. Information should be documented adequately,
enabling health care professionals to access the information needed and to make sound
decisions.

People working in hospital administration also must be well informed in order to carry
out their tasks. They should be informed timely and receive current information. If the infor-
mation flow is too slow, bills are written days or even weeks after the patient’s discharge. If
information is missing, payable services cannot be billed, and the hospital's income will be
reduced. For example, under certain circumstances, the amount payable by the health insur-
ance is reduced, if the invoice from the hospital arrives after a certain deadline.

Hospital management also has an enormous information need. Up-to-date information
about costs and proceeds are necessary as a basis for controlling the enterprise. Information
about the quality of patient care is equally important, for example, about the form and sever-
ity of patients’ illnesses, about nosocomial infections, or about complication rates of thera-
peutic procedures. Ifthis information is not accurate, not on time, or incomplete, the hospitals
work cannot be controlled adequately, increasing the risks of management errors.

Thus, information processing is an important quality factor in health care and, in par-
ticular, in hospitals.

2.2.2
Information Processing as Cost Factor

In 2007, member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) spent between 6 and 15% of their total gross domestic product (GDP) on health care.'

'Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD Health Data 2008.
Statistics and Indicators for 30 countries. http://www.oecd.org
#2.2 Significance of Information Processing in Health care 5

In 2006, the costs for the approximately 2,100 German hospitals with their 510,000 beds
amounted to €60 billion; 1.1 million people worked in these organizations in Germany, and 17
million inpatients were treated.? In the USA, hospital spending was nearly $600 billion. The
overall US national health expenditure reached $2.2 trillion in 2007, and accounted for 16.2%
of the Gross Domestic Product.’

A relevant percentage of those costs is spent on information processing. However, the
total percentage of information processing can only be estimated. Already in the 1960s,
studies observed that 25% of a hospital’s costs are due to (computer-based and non-
computer-based) information processing.* However, such an estimate depends on the defi-
nition of information processing. In general, the investment costs (including purchase,
adaptation, introduction, and training) must be distinguished from the operating costs
(including continued maintenance and support as well as staff), and the costs for computer-
based from the costs for non-computer-based information processing (which still are often
much higher in hospitals).

Looking at computer-based information processing, the annual budget that health care
institutions spend on information and communication technology (ICT) (including com-
puter systems, computer networks, and computer-based application components) was in
2006 between 2.5% and 3.3% of the total hospital operating expense, depending on the
number of beds.® In many hospitals, the annual budget is even lower. Most hospital chief
information officers (CIOs) expect an increasing budget.®

‘When looking at non-computer-based information processing (see Fig. 2.2, for exam-
ple), the numbers become increasingly vague. However, we can expect that, for example,
the annual operating costs (including personnel costs) for a non-computer-based archive,
storing about 300,000-400,000 new patients records each year, may easily amount to more
than €500,000. A typical, standardized, machine-readable form, including two carbon cop-
ies (a radiology order, for example) costs approximately €0.50. A typical inpatient record
at a university hospital consists of about 40 documents.

Based on these figures, it becomes apparent that information processing in health
care is an important cost factor and considerably significant for a national economy.
It is clear that, on the one hand, efficient information processing offers vast potential
for cost reductions. On the other hand, inefficient information processing leads to cost
increases.

Information as Productivity Factor

In the nineteenth century, many societies were characterized by rising industry and
industrial production. By the second half of the twentieth century, the idea of
communicating and processing data by means of computers and computer networks
was already emerging. Today we speak of the twenty-first century as the century of
information technology, or of an “information society.” Informatics and information
and communication technology (ICT) are playing a key role. Information, bound to a
medium of matter or energy, but largely independent of place and time, shall be made
available to people at any time and in any place imaginable. Information shall find its
way to people, not vice versa.

Today, information belongs to the most important productivity factors of a hospital.
Productivity is defined as a ratio of output and input. All resources like personnel, medical
devices, etc. are part of the input. Therefore, from an economic point of view, productivity
of a hospital might be defined as the ratio of the number of cases and full-time employees.
If, however, output is considered as quality of patient care, it is much more difficult to
calculate productivity. Therefore, a lot of reliable clinical data are needed. For high-quality
patient care and economic management of a hospital, it is essential that the hospital infor-
mation system can make correct information fully available on time. This is also increas-
ingly important for the competitiveness of hospitals.

2.24
Holistic View of the Patient

Information processing in a hospital should offer a comprehensive, holistic view of
the patient and of the hospital. “Holistic” in this context means to have a complete
picture of the care of a patient available, independent of the health care institutions

Fig.2.3 An example of the patient summary within an electronic patient record

and hospital departments in which the patient has been or will be treated. This holistic
view on the patient can reduce undesired consequences of highly specialized medicine
with various departments and health care professionals involved in patient care.
Despite highly differentiated diagnostics and therapy, and the multitude of people and
areas in a hospital, adequate information processing (and a good hospital information
system) can help to make information about a patient available completely (Fig. 2.3).
As specialization in medicine and health care increases, so does the fragmentation of
information, which makes combining information into such a holistic view more and
more necessary. However, it must be clearly ensured that only authorized personnel
can access patient data and data about the hospital as an enterprise.

2.2.5
Hospital Information System as Memory and Nervous System

Figuratively speaking, a hospital information system might be regarded as the memory
and the nervous system of a hospital. A hospital information system, comprising the
information processing and storage in a hospital (Figs. 2.4 and 2.5), to a certain extent
can be compared to the information processing of a human being. The hospital infor-
mation system also receives, transmits, processes, stores, and presents information.
The quality of a hospital information system is essential for a hospital, again figura-
tively, in order to be able to adequately recognize and store facts, to remember them,
and to act on them.

2.3.1
Impact on the Quality of Health Care

Progress in information and communication technology (ICT) changes societies and
affects the costs and quality of information processing in health care. It is thus useful to
take a look at the world of information and communication technology.

Tremendous improvements in diagnostics have been made available by modem tech-
nology, for example, in the area of medical signal and image processing. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging and computer tomography, for example, would not have been possible
without improvements in information processing and information methodology and with-
out modern information and communication technology (see Fig. 2.6). Improved diagnos-
tics then lead to an improvement in therapy. Some therapies, for example, in neurosurgery
or radiotherapy, are possible mainly due to the progress in ICT. The same is true in the field
of medical biotechnology: the development of new drug agents, research in molecular
principles of diseases, and the resulting new patient-specific therapeutic option enable a
better treatment of patients.

Nowadays, clinical research can to an increasing degree be conducted with success, and
be internationally competitive, only if carried out on an interdisciplinary, often also

inter-regional or international, and collaborative basis. This collaboration has been and is
fostered by integrated systems of information technology. The translation of medical
research outcomes into new therapies needs tight information exchange from “bench” to
“bed”, that is, from research to patient care. Vice versa information about experiences with
therapies is collected by computer-based tools within clinical trials and is resent to and
carefully analyzed at research institutions.

Important progress due to improvements in modern ICT can also be observed in infor-
mation systems of health care organizations. The role of computer-based information
systems, together with clinical documentation and knowledge-based decision support sys-
tems, can hardly be overestimated in respect to the quality of health care, as the volume of
data available today is much greater than it was a few years ago.

Impact on Economics

For many countries, the vision of an “information society” has become a reality. Nearly
every modern economic branch is shaped by information processing and information and
communication technology.

The worldwide information and communication technology market volume is estimated
at nearly €2.5 trillion in 2009 with a growth rate of about 5% per year.” Germany’s expected
total annual turnover on information and communication technology was approximately
€146 billion in 2008. Generally, half of this money is spent on information technology (data
processing and data communication equipment, software, and related services) and the other
half on communication technology (telecommunication equipment and related services).

ICT has become a major factor for quality and efficiency of health care worldwide.
ICT in health care also emerged to a leading industry branch. The percentage of health
care ICT on the worldwide ICT market is difficult to estimate. The following numbers
may indicate the significance of ICT in health care: In the U.S. the estimated total expen-
ditures of ICT equipment and software in health care were about $21 billion in 2007,
which is 8.1% of the total US ICT expenditures.’ Reports from the European Union (EU)

state that the eHealth industry in the EU (defined as comprising clinical information sys-
tems, telemedicine and homecare, and regional networks) was estimated “to be worth
close to €21 billion in 2006” and that the global eHealth industry “has the potential to be
the third largest industry in the health sector with a global turnover of €50-60 billion”!
Many countries established programs to force information and communication techno-
logy especially in the eHealth segment with investment volumes between $50 million and
$11.5 billion."

One might have doubts about the validity of these rather rough numbers. However, they
all exemplify the following: There is a significant and increasing economic relevance not
only for information and communication technology in general but also in health care.

23.3
Changing Health Care

Now once more, what changes in health care do we expect through information and com-
munication technology?

The developments mentioned will probably continue into the next decade at least at the
same rate as given today. The development of information and communication technology
will continue to have a considerable effect on our societies in general and on our health
care systems in particular.

The use of computer-based tools in health care is dramatically increasing, and new
technologies such as mobile devices and multifunctional bedside terminals will prolifer-
ate. Those mobile information processing tools offer both communication and information
processing features. Wireless networks are standard in many hospitals. Computer-based
training systems strongly support efficient learning for health care professionals.
Documentation efforts are continuously rising and lead to more sophisticated computer-
based documentation tools (see Fig. 2.7). Decision support tools, for example, in the con-
text of drug prescription, support high-quality care. Communication is increasingly
supported by electronic means. The globalization of providing health care and the coop-
eration of health care professionals is increasing, and patients and health care professionals
seek reliable health information on the Internet. Large health databases are available for
everyone at his or her work place and global companies offer personal health records
worldwide for everyone. Providing high-quality and efficient health care will continue to
be strongly correlated with high-quality information and communication technology and a

sound methodology for systematically processing information. However, the newest infor-
mation and communication technologies do not guarantee high-quality information pro-
cessing. Both information processing technologies and methodologies must adequately
and responsibly be applied and, as will be pointed out later on, systematically managed.Importance of Systematic Information Management

24.1
Affected People and Areas

Nearly all people and all areas of a hospital are affected by the quality of the information
system, as most of them need various types of information (e.g., about the patient) in their
daily work. The patient can certainly profit most from high-quality information processing
since it contributes to the quality of patient care and to reducing costs.

The professional groups working in a hospital, especially physicians, nurses, and
administrative personnel, and others are also directly affected by the quality of the infor-
mation system. As they spend 25% or even more of their time on information handling,
they directly profit from good and efficient information processing. However, they will
also feel the consequences if information processing is poor.
#2.4 Importance of Systematic Information Management 13

24.2
Amount of Information Processing

The amount of information processing in hospitals, especially in larger ones, should not be
underestimated. Let us look at a typical German university medical center. It is an enter-
prise encompassing staff of approximately 4,500 people, an annual budget of approxi-
mately €250 million, and, as a maximum care facility, numerous tasks in research,
education, and patient care. It consists of up to 60 departments and up to 100 wards with
up to 1,500 beds and about 100 outpatient units. Annually, approximately, 50,000 inpa-
tients and 250,000 outpatients are treated, and 20,000 operation reports, 250,000 discharge
letters, 20,000 pathology reports, 100,000 microbiology reports, 200,000 radiology reports,
and 800,000 clinical chemistry reports are written.

Each year, approximately 300,000-400,000 new patient records, summing up to
approximately eight million pieces of paper, are created (Fig. 2.8). When stored in a paper-
based way, an annual record volume of approximately 1,500 m is generated. In Germany,
for example, they should be archived over a period of 30 years. When stored digitally, the
annual data volume needed is expected to be around 10-15 terabytes, including digital
images and digital signals.

The computer-based tools of a university medical center encompass more than hundred
of the computer-based application components, thousands of workstations and other

terminals, and more than hundred servers (larger computer systems that offer services and
features to other computer systems), and the respective network.

The numbers in the majority of hospitals are much smaller. In larger ones we will find,
for example, about ten departments with 600 beds and about 20,000 inpatients every year.
In industrialized countries 1,500 staff members would work there, and the annual budget
of the hospital would be about €80 million. Especially in rural areas, we can also find hos-
pitals with only one department and fewer than 50 beds.Sharing the Same Data

There are different reasons for pursuing holistic and integrated information processing.
The most important reason is that various groups of health care professionals within and
outside health care institutions need the same data (Fig. 2.9).

For example, a surgeon in a hospital documents the diagnoses and therapies of an oper-
ated patient in an operation report. This report serves as basis for the discharge letter. The
discharge letter is also an important document to communicate with the admitting institu-
tion, normally a general practitioner. Diagnosis and therapy are also important for statistics
about patient care and for quality management. Equally, they contain important informa-
tion for the systematic nursing care of a patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic data are also
relevant for billing.

In Germany, for example, some basic administrative data must be communicated to the
respective health insurance company online within 3 days after patient admission and after
discharge. In a coded form, they are the basis for accounting. Additionally, managing and
controlling a hospital is possible only if the cost (such as consumption of materials or
drugs) of the treatment can be compared to the characteristics and severity of the illness,
characterized by diagnosis and therapy.

care professionals on a ward

#2.4 Importance of Systematic Information Management 15Integrated Information Processing to Satisfy Information Needs

Information processing has to integrate the partly overlapping information needs of the
different groups and areas of a hospital (see Fig. 2.10).

Systematic, integrated information processing in a hospital has advantages not only for
the patient, but also for the health care professionals, the health insurance companies, and
the hospital owners. If information processing is not conducted globally across institutions,
but locally, for example, in professional groups (physicians, nurses, and administrative
staff) or areas (clinical departments, institutes, and administration), this corresponds to tra-
ditional separation politics and leads to isolated information processing groups, such as “the
administration” or “the clinic.” In this case, the quality of the hospital information system
clearly decreases while the costs for information processing increase due to the necessity
for multiple data collection and analysis. Finally, this has disadvantages for the patient and,
when seen from a national economical point of view, for the whole population.

However, integration of information processing should consider not only information
processing in one health care organization, but also information processing among differ-
ent institutions (such as integrated health care delivery systems). The achievements of
modern medicine, particularly in the field of acute diseases, have led to the paradoxical
result that chronic diseases and multimorbidity increasingly gain in relevance. Among
other reasons, this is due to more people being able to live to old age. Moreover, in many

countries, an increasing willingness to switch doctors and a higher regional mobility exist
among patients. The degree of highly specialized and distributed patient care creates a
great demand for integrated information processing among health care professionals and
among health care institutions such as hospitals, general practices, laboratories, etc. In
turn, this raises the need for more comprehensive documentation and efficient, compre-
hensive information systems.

2.4.5
Raising the Quality of Patient Care and Reducing Costs

Systematic information processing is the key factor for raising quality and reducing
costs. What does “systematic” mean in this context? “Unsystematic” can, in a positive
sense, mean creative, spontaneous, or flexible. However, “unsystematic” can also mean
chaotic, purposeless, and ineffective, and also entail high costs compared to the benefits
gained.

“Systematic” in this context means purposeful and effective, and with great benefit
regarding the costs. Bearing this in mind, it is obvious that information processing in a
health care institution should be managed systematically. Due to the importance of infor-
mation processing as a quality and cost factor, an institution has to invest systematically
in its health information system. These investments deal with both staff and tools for
information processing. They aim at increasing quality of patient care and at reducing
costs.

Unsystematic information processing normally leads to a low quality of health information
systems, and the information needs of the staff and departments cannot be adequately satis-
fied. When health information systems are not systematically managed, they tend to develop
in a chaotic way. This has severe consequences: decreased data quality, and higher costs,
especially for tools and information processing staff, not to mention aspects such as data pro-
tection and data security violation. Even worse, insufficiently managed information systems
can contribute to breakdowns in established clinical workflows, to a reduced efficiency of
care, to user boycott, to decreased quality of care and — in the end — even endanger patient
safety.

To adequately process information and apply information and communication technol-
ogy, knowledge and skills for these tasks are required.

2.4.6
Basis of Systematic Information Processing

If the hospital management decides to invest in systematic information processing (and not
in fighting the effects of chaotic information processing, which normally means much
higher investments), it decides to manage the hospital information system in a systematic
way. The management of a hospital information system forms and controls the information
system, and it ensures its efficient operation.

Knowledge Access to Improve Patient Care

Imagine the following situation: Ursula B. was pregnant with quintuplets. She had already
spent more than 5 months in a University Medical Center. She had to spend most of this
time lying in bed. During the course of her pregnancy, her physical problems increased.
From the 28th week on, she suffered severe respiratory distress.

Professor L., the pediatrician, who was also involved in her treatment, had the fol-
lowing question: What are the chances of the infants being born healthy at this gesta-
tional age?

He went to a computer, which is connected to the computer network of the University
Medical Center. The physician called up a function “knowledge access” and, as applica-
tion component, a literature database (MEDLINE), which contains the current state of
the art of medical knowledge worldwide (Fig. 2.11).

The following information resulted from this knowledge access: Several publications
stated that only slim chances exist for all infants to survive in good health. If they are born
during the 28th week of pregnancy, the chance for survival is about 15%. In case of birth
during the 30th week, their chances would improve to about 75%. Also, according to the
literature, further delay of the delivery does not improve the prognosis of the quintuplets.

importance.

Today, knowledge access at a ward is in many hospitals an integrated part of a hospital
information system.

You may wonder, in which year and in which medical center the quintuplets were born.
It was in 1999 at the Heidelberg University Medical Center. Although this real example
dates back more than 10 years we found it still worth to report on because it shows clearly
how important it is to have information and knowledge available, and in this respect is
pioneering for the future trends.

By the way, all quintuples are well and Prof. L., the attending physician, became their
godfather.

Table 2.1 shows statistics with patients having diagnosis A, for example, rheumatism,
and treated during the years 8, for example, 1991-2001, at PMC. The patients have either
received standard therapy, Verum, or a new therapy, Novum.

Comparing the success rates of Novum and Verum, one might conclude that the
new therapy is better than the standard therapy. Applying an appropriate statistical test
would lead to a low p value and a significant result. The success rate was also analyzed
by sex. This resulted in Verum leading in female patients as well as in male patients.

Is one of our conclusions erroneous? Or maybe both? What would a systematic design
and analysis of such a register be? After looking at the data, one can identify a fairly simple
reason for this so-called Simpson’s paradox. The methodology for processing information
systematically ought to prevent such errors; however, it is far more complex.The WHO eHealth Resolution™

Examples of quantified potentials include:

Five million yearly outpatient prescription errors could be avoided through the use of
Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions.

100,000 yearly inpatient adverse drug events could be avoided through Computerized
Physician Order Entry and Clinical Decision Support. This would in turn free up
700,000 bed-days yearly, an opportunity for increasing throughput and decreasing wait-
ing times, corresponding to a value of almost €300 million.

49,000 cases of inpatient Hospital Acquired Infections could be avoided every year
collectively through the use of Business Intelligence and Data Mining for real time
detection of in-hospital infections. This could increase availability by over 270,000
bed-days, resulting in opportunity savings of over €131 million.

11,000 deaths caused by complications related to diabetes could collectively be
reduced through Electronic Medical Records with Chronic Disease Management
capabilities.

5.6 million admissions to hospitals for chronically ill patients could be avoided collec-

Information processing is an important quality factor, but an enormous cost factor as well.
It is also becoming a productivity factor. Information processing should offer a holistic
view of the patient and of the hospital. A hospital information system can be regarded as
the memory and nervous system of a hospital.

Information and communication technology has become economically important and
decisive for the quality of health care. It will continue to change health care.

The integrated processing of information is important, because

e all groups of people and all areas of a hospital depend on its quality,

e the amount of information processing in hospitals is considerable, and
® health care professionals frequently work with the same data.

The systematic processing of information
e contributes to high-quality patient care , and
e reduces costs.

Information processing in hospitals is complex. Therefore,

e the systematic management and operation of hospital information systems, and

e medical informatics specialists responsible for the management, and operation of
hospital information systems are needed.
##Information System BasicsIntroduction

Every domain usually has its own terminology, which often differs from the ordinary
understanding of concepts and terms. This chapter presents the terminology for informa-
tion systems and their management, as used in this book. It is, therefore, essential to read
this chapter carefully. All relevant concepts can also be found in the Thesaurus at the end
of the book.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What is the difference between data, information, and knowledge?

e What are information systems, and what are their components?

e What is information management?Data, Information, and Knowledge

Data constitute reinterpretable representations of information, or knowledge, in a formal-
ized manner suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by humans or
machines. Formalization may take the form of discrete characters or of continuous signals
(e.g., sound signals). To be reinterpretable, there has to be an agreement on how data rep-
resent information. For example, “Peter Smith” or “001001110” are data. A set of data that
is put together for the purpose of transmission and that is considered to be one entity for
this purpose is called a message.

There is no unique definition of information. Depending on the point of view, the defini-
tion may deal with a syntactic aspect (the structure), a semantic aspect (the meaning), or a
pragmatic aspect (the intention or goal of information). We will simply define information
as specific determination about entities such as facts, events, things, persons, processes,
ideas, or concepts. For example, when a physician determines the diagnosis (facts) of a
patient (person), then he or she has information.

#26 3 Information System Basics

Knowledge is general information about concepts in a certain (scientific or professional)
domain (e.g., about diseases, therapeutic methods). Knowledge contrasts with specific infor-
mation about particular individuals of the domain (e.g., patients). The knowledge of a nurse,
for example, comprises how to typically deal with patients suffering from decubitus.

For the sake of simplicity, we will often use the term information processing when we
mean processing of data together with its related information and knowledge.Information Systems and Their Components

3.3.1
Systems and Subsystems

Before talking about information systems, let us first define the concept system. As defined
here, a system is a set of persons, things, events, and their relationships that forms an inte-
grated whole. We distinguish between natural systems and artificial (man-made) systems.
For example, the nervous system is a typical natural system, consisting of neurons and
their relationships. A man-made system is, for example, a hospital, consisting of staff,
patients, and relatives, and their interactions. If a (man-made) system consists of both
human and technical components, it can be called a socio-technical system.

A system can, in principle, be divided into subsystems that comprise a subset of the
components and the relationships between them. For example, a possible subsystem of the
nervous system is the sympathetic nervous system. A subsystem of a hospital is, for exam-
ple, a ward with its staff and patients.

Subsystems themselves are again systems.

33.2
Information Systems

An information system is that part of an institution that processes and stores data, informa-
tion, and knowledge. It can be defined as that socio-technical subsystem of an institution,
which comprises all information processing as well as the associated human or technical
actors in their respective information processing roles. This means that, for example, the
computers, printers, telephones, as well as the staff using them to manage information are
part of the information system of an institution.

“Socio-" refers to the people involved in information processing (e.g., health care
professionals, administrative staff, and computer scientists), whereas “technical” refers to
information processing tools (e.g., computers, telephones, and patient records). The people
and machines in an institution are considered only in their role as information processors,
carrying out specific actions following established rules.

An information system that comprises computer-based information processing and
communication tools is called a computer-based information system. An information
#3.3 Information Systems and Their Components 27

system can be divided into subsystems, which are called sub-information systems. For
example, the information system of an institution can be split into two sub-information
systems: the part where computer-based tools are used is called the computer-based part;
the rest is called the non-computer-based part of an information system.

33.3
Components of Information Systems

‘When describing an information system, it can help to look at the following typical com-
ponents of information systems: enterprise functions, business processes, application com-
ponents, and physical data processing systems.

An enterprise function describes what acting human or machines have to do in a certain
enterprise to contribute to its mission and goals. For example, patient admission, medical
and nursing care planning, or financial accounting describe typical enterprise functions.
Enterprise functions are ongoing and continuous. They describe what is to be done, not how
it is done. Enterprise functions can be structured into a hierarchy of enterprise functions,
where an enterprise function can be described in more detail by refined sub-functions.
Enterprise functions are usually denoted by nouns or gerunds (i.e., words ending with -ing).
The actions summarized by an enterprise function are in most cases significantly dealing
with information processing. Later on we will focus more strictly on this aspect and there-
fore restrict to information processing enterprise functions (see Sect. 5.3.2.1).

For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to enterprise functions as hospital functions, if
the respective enterprise is a hospital.

An activity is an instantiation of an enterprise function. For example, “the physician
admits the patient Smith” is an activity of the enterprise function patient admission. In
contrast to enterprise functions, activities have a definite beginning and end.

To describe how an enterprise function is performed, not only may information about
its refined sub-functions be needed, but information about their chronological and logical
sequence may also be needed. With business processes, the sequence of (sub-)functions
together with the conditions under which they are performed can be described. Business
processes are usually denoted by verbs, which can be followed by a noun (e.g., “admitting
a patient,” “planning care” or “writing a discharge letter”). Process instances are composed
of the individual activities; hence they also have a definite beginning and end. While enter-
prise functions concentrate on the “what,” business processes focus on the “how” of activi-
ties. Enterprise functions can be considered as representatives of business processes.

‘Whereas enterprise functions describe what is done, we now want to consider tools for
processing data, in particular application components and physical data processing sys-
tems. Both are usually referred to as information processing tools. They describe the means
used for information processing.

Application components support enterprise functions. We distinguish computer-based
from non-computer-based application components. Computer-based application components
are controlled by software products. A software product is an acquired or self-developed

"We will give little bit more formal definition of these terms later on in Sect. 5.3.2.
#28 3 Information System Basics

piece of software that can be installed on a computer system. For example, the computer-
based application component patient administration system stands for the installation of a
software product to support enterprise functions such as patient admission and administra-
tive discharge and billing.

Non-computer-based application components are controlled by working plans that
describe how people use certain physical data processing systems. For example, a non-
computer-based application component called nursing management and documentation
system is controlled by rules regarding how, by whom, and in which context given forms
for nursing documentation have to be used. In this example, the paper-based forms that are
used represent physical data processing systems (see Fig. 3.1).

Communication and cooperation among application components must be organized in
such a way that the enterprise functions are adequately supported.

Physical data processing systems, finally, describe the information processing tools that
are used to implement computer-based as well as non-computer-based application compo-
nents. Physical data processing systems can be human actors (such as the person delivering
mail), non-computer-based physical tools such as forms for nursing documentation,
paper-based patient records or telephones, or computer systems (such as terminals, serv-
ers, and personal computers). Computer systems can be physically connected via data
wires, leading to physical networks. Figure 3.2 shows some typical physical data processing

processing system. The rules that describe who may use these forms, and how they should be used,
make up the application component

systems. The printer, for example, could contribute in the implementation of the applica-
tion component medical documentation system by printing documentation forms.

Details on the most relevant information processing tools in hospitals can be found in
Sects. 6.4 and 6.6.Architecture and Infrastructure of Information Systems

The architecture of an information system describes its fundamental organization, repre-
sented by its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and by
the principles guiding its design and evolution? The architecture of an information system
can be described by the enterprise functions, the business processes, the information
processing tools, and their relationships.

There may be several architectural views of an information system, for example, a
functional view looking primarily at the enterprise functions, a process view looking pri-
marily at the business processes, etc. Architectures that are equivalent with regard to
certain characteristics can be summarized in a certain architectural style.

#30 3 Information System Basics

‘When the focus is put onto the types, number, and availability of information process-
ing tools used in a given enterprise, this is also called the infrastructure of an information

system.Information Management

In general, management comprises all leadership activities that determine the institution’s
goals, structures, and behaviors. Accordingly, information management (or management
of information systems) comprises those management activities that deal with the
management of information processing in an institution, for example, a hospital. The goal
of information management is systematic information processing that contributes to the
institution’s strategic goals (such as efficient patient care and high satisfaction of patients
and staff in a hospital). Information management therefore directly contributes to the insti-
tution’s success and ability to compete.

The general tasks of information management are planning, directing, and monitoring. In
other words, this means

e planning the information system and its architecture,

e directing its establishment and its operation , and

e monitoring its development and operation with respect to the planned objectives .

Information management encompasses the management of all components of an
information system — the management of enterprise functions and business processes, of
application components, and of physical data processing systems.

Information management can be differentiated into strategic, tactical, and operational
information management. Strategic information management deals with information
processing as a whole. Tactical information management deals with particular enterprise
functions or with application components that are introduced, removed, or changed.
Operational information management, finally, is responsible for operating the components
of the information system. It cares for its smooth operation, for example, by planning
necessary personal resources, by failure management, or by network monitoring.
Information management in hospitals is discussed in detail in Sect. 9.2.

#32 3 Information System Basics

A system is a set of persons, things, events, and their relationships that form an integrated
whole. Systems can be divided into subsystems.

An information system can be defined as the socio-technical subsystem of an institu-
tion, which comprises all information processing as well as the associated human or tech-
nical actors in their respective information processing roles. Typical components of
information systems are:

o the enterprise functions supported;

o the business processes that take place;

o the application components that support the enterprise functions;

o the physical data processing systems the application components are executed on.

The subsystem of an information system where computer-based tools are used is called the
computer-based part of the information system. The architecture of an information system
describes its fundamental organization, represented by its components, their relationships
to each other and to the environment, and by the principles guiding its design and
evolution.

Information management comprises those management activities in an institution that
deal with the management of information processing and therefore with the management
of the institution’s information system.
#Health Information SystemsIntroduction

An information system was previously defined as the socio-technical subsystem of an
institution, which comprises all information processing as well as the associated human or
technical actors in their respective information processing roles. Health information sys-
tems (HIS) are dealing with processing data, information, and knowledge in health care
environments. Especially with regard to chronic diseases, it becomes more and more
important to organize health care in a patient-centric way, such that all participating in- or
outpatient care institutions cooperate very closely. This is also denoted as integrated care.
In integrated care it is necessary to provide relevant information not only within a single
institution, but wherever and whenever it is needed. This includes medical practices, reha-
bilitation centers, nursing centers, and even the home of the patient. We therefore differen-
tiate institutional and transinstitutional health information systems. In the following, we
will introduce hospital information systems, which are the most complex instances of
institutional information systems, and transinstitutional information systems. Throughout
the book we will use the term health information system and the abbreviation HIS if we
discuss aspects concerning both hospital information systems and transinstitutional infor-
mation systems. If we deal with properties being unique for one of these, we will use the
terms hospital information system and transinstitutional information system, respectively.
After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What are hospital information systems?

e What are transinstitutional health information systems?

e What are the challenges for health information systems?

e What are electronic health records?Hospital Information Systems

With the definition of information systems in mind, a hospital information system can be
easily defined. A hospital information system is the socio-technical subsystem of a hospi-
tal, which comprises all information processing as well as the associated human or technical

actors in their respective information processing roles. Typical components of hospital

information systems are enterprise functions, business processes, application components,

and physical data processing systems (see Sect. 3.3.3). For the sake of simplicity, we will
refer to enterprise functions of a hospital as hospital functions.

As a consequence of this definition, a hospital has a hospital information system from
the beginning of its existence. Therefore, the question is not whether a hospital should be
equipped with a hospital information system, but rather how its performance can be
enhanced, for example, by using state-of-the-art information processing tools, or by sys-
tematically managing it.

All groups of people and all areas of a hospital must be considered when looking at
information processing. The sensible integration of the different information processing
tools in a hospital information system is important.

Hospital staff can be seen as part of the hospital information system. For example, when
working in the department of patient records or as an operator in a department for informa-
tion and communication technology, staff members directly contribute to information pro-
cessing. However, in their role as user of the hospital information system, they use
information processing tools (e.g., a nurse may use a telephone or a computer). Each
employee may continuously switch between these two roles.

The goal of a hospital information system is to sufficiently enable the adequate execu-
tion of hospital functions for patient care, including patient administration, taking into
account economic hospital management as well as legal and other requirements. Legal
requirements concern, for example, data protection or reimbursement aspects. Other
requirements can be, for example, the decision of a hospital executive board on how to
store patient records.

To support patient care and the associated administration, the tasks of hospital information

systems are:

e To make information, primarily about patients, available: current information should be
provided on time, at the right location, to authorized staff, in an appropriate and usable
form. For this purpose, data must be correctly collected, stored, processed, and system-
atically documented to ensure that correct, pertinent, and up-to-date patient information
can be supplied, for instance, to the physician or a nurse (Fig. 4.1).

e To make knowledge, for example, about diseases, side effects, and interactions of medi-
cations available to support diagnostics and therapy.

e To make information about the quality of patient care and the performance and cost
situation within the hospital available.

In addition to patient care, university medical centers undertake research and education to
gain medical knowledge and to teach students.

so that these people can make the right decisions, this is also described as information and

knowledge logistics.
Hospital information systems have to consider various areas of a hospital, such as

wards,

outpatient units,

service units: diagnostic (e.g., laboratory department, radiology department), therapeu-
tic (e.g., operation room), and others (e.g., pharmacy, patient records archive, library,
blood bank),

hospital administration areas (e.g., patient administration department, patient record
archive, department of quality management, financial and controlling department,
department of facility management, information management department, general
administration department, human resources department),

offices and writing services for (clinical) report writing.

In addition, there are the management areas, such as hospital management, management
of clinical and non-clinical departments, administration management, and nursing
management.

These areas are related to patient care. They could be broken down further. For univer-

sity medical centers, additional areas, needed for research and education, must be added to
the above list.
Obviously, the most important people in a hospital are the

patients and, in certain respects, their
visitors.
#36 4 Health Information Systems

The most important groups of people working in a hospital are
physicians,

nurses,

administrative staff,

technical staff and

medical informaticians and other health information management staff.

Within each group of people, different needs and demands on the hospital information
system may exist, depending on the role, tasks, and responsibilities. Ward physicians, for
example, require information that is different from that required by physicians working in
service units or by senior physicians. Patients sometimes need similar information as phy-
sicians but in a different form.Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

In many countries, the driving force for health care and for ICT in health care has
recently been the trend toward a better coordination of care, combined with rising
cost pressure. One consequence is the shift toward better integrated and shared care.
This means that the focus changes from isolated procedures in one health care insti-
tution (e.g., one hospital or one general practice) to the patient-oriented care process,
encompassing diagnosis and therapy, spreading over institutional boundaries
(Fig. 4.2).

A group of two or more legally separated health care institutions that have temporarily
and voluntarily joined together to achieve a common purpose are defined as a health care
network. The information system of a health care network is called a transinstitutional
health information system. Typical examples are regional health information systems,
comprising the health care environment in a certain region, including, for example, hospi-
tals, offices of general practitioners, pharmacies, rehabilitation centers, home care organi-
zations, and even health insurances and governmental authorities.

In the United States, for example, health care institutions are merging into large
integrated health care delivery systems. These are systems of health care institutions
that join together to consolidate their roles, resources, and operations to deliver a coor-
dinated range of services and to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of patient care.
The situation in Europe is also changing from hospitals as centers of care delivery to
decentralized networks of health care delivery institutions that are called regional net-
works or health care networks. Enterprise boundaries are blurring. Hospital information
systems will increasingly be linked with information systems of other health care
institutions.

For example, the Hannover Medical School, a large hospital with 75 departments and
more than 1,400 patient beds, provides a web portal for its partners, where patient data
can be shared and mutually updated by all institutions participating in patient care.
Among others, a rehabilitation clinic in Fallingbostel, 50 km north of Hannover, has

access to the data of transplant patients, who need time to recover after their operation has
taken place, without the need for expensive intensive care treatment. By electronically
linking both facilities, the most cost-effective treatment process and optimal time of
transfer to the rehabilitation facility can be chosen without loss of quality due to infor-
mation lags.

The architecture of hospital information systems must take these developments into
account. They must be able to provide access or to exchange patient-related and gene-
ral data (e.g., about the services offered in the hospital) across its institutional
boundaries.

A lot of technical and legal issues have to be solved before computer-based transinsti-
tutional health information systems will adequately support transinstitutional patient care.
For example, a general willingness to cooperate with other health care providers must
exist; optimal care processes must be defined, and recent business processes be redesigned;
accounting and financing issues must be regulated; questions of data security and data
confidentiality must be answered, together with questions on data ownership (patient or
institution) and on responsibilities for distributed patient care; issues on long-term patient
records (centralized or decentralized) must be discussed; and technical means for inte-
grated, transinstitutional information processing must be offered (telemedicine, eHealth),
including general communication standards.
#38 4 Health Information SystemsElectronic Health Records as a Part of Health Information Systems

The most important enterprise functions in health care are related to diagnostics and ther-
apy. Obviously, data that are relevant to medical decision making need to be collected and
presented in a patient record.

A patient record in general is composed of all data and documents generated or received
during the care of a patient at a health care institution. Nowadays, many documents in the
paper-based patient record are computer printouts, such as laboratory results, or discharge sum-
maries typed into a text processing system. The portion of documents created in computer-
based form will further increase. Thus, it seems natural to strive for a patient record that is partly
or completely stored on electronic document carriers: the electronic health record (EHR).

The electronic health record (EHR) is the collection of medical data relating to one subject
of care, i.e., the patient, that is stored in the computer-based part of a health information sys-
tem. “The EHR for a subject of care might be scattered physically across multiple (discrete or
interconnected) clinical systems and repositories, each of which will hold and manage a par-
tial EHR for each of its data subjects, scoped according to the service or community settings,
clinical domains and time periods of use of that system in the life of each person.”

Primarily, EHRs are used to support patient care by providing relevant information
about a patient whenever and wherever it is needed. Furthermore, they are needed for
administrative functions, such as billing and quality management.

In the past, EHR used to be provider-centric, i.e., they only contained patient informa-
tion that was recorded in one institution, for example, in a hospital or in a physician’s office.
Those EHR are usually called electronic patient records (EPR). Hence, potentially relevant
information about the medical history of a patient that was recorded in other institutions
was missing or had to be recorded again. This led to quality and efficiency problems.

Although this situation can still be found in many institutions, efforts are being made
today to organize EHRs patient-centric, i.e. independent of institutional boundaries. To
achieve the vision of a complete and lifetime-spanning EHR which supports health care on
the one hand, but respects legal and ethical issues on the other hand, different strategies
can be found. These are described in Sect. 7.3.2.Challenges for Health Information Systems

In spite of the positive general development of health information systems, challenges can
be identified that have to be resolved. Evolutionary grown information systems (remember
that hospitals have an information system from the beginning of their existence) consist of
a variety of components and tend to be very heterogeneous. As a consequence, major chal-
lenges exist. In anticipation of concepts that are introduced later in this book, we want to
sensibilize you for the following challenges:

'Standard ISO/Draft International Standard 18308
#4.5 Challenges for Health Information Systems 39

eo The challenge of user acceptance. Health care professionals or hospital managers
as users of heterogeneous health information systems may have the need to over-
view a broad variety of data. They will have difficulties or will at least have the
problem of having to use a set of application components, often with different user
interfaces, overlapping features, and separate user identification procedures. This is
time-consuming and potentially dangerous for the patient, as important data may
not be available when needed, leading to wrong diagnostic or therapeutic
decisions.

o The challenge of data redundancy. As different health care professionals often need
the same data (see Sect. 2.3), heterogeneous information systems typically lead to data
duplication: Relevant data may be documented several times at different sites and or by
different providers. This double-documentation is time-consuming for staff and patients
and error-prone, as documented data may be inconsistent or incomplete. In addition,
uncontrolled redundancy causes considerable additional maintenance costs for updat-
ing duplicated data in (redundant) databases.

o The challenge of transcription. In heterogeneous architectures there is a considerable
amount of transcription, i.e., the transfer of data from one storage device to another
(e.g., the transfer of a patient’s diagnoses from the patient record to an order entry
form). Media cracks, i.e. the change of the storage media during the transcription of
data. are often the cause of errors. Both may decrease the quality of data and both do
increase costs as well as the health care professional’s time needed for recording and
accessing patient data.

e The challenge of maintaining referential integrity. For redundant data, either as rep-
licates or even as duplicates, it is difficult to obtain and later maintain referential inte-
grity, i.e., the correct assignment of entities, for example the assignment of data to a
certain patient (see Sect. 6.5.2.2).

o The challenge of costs. Too high, in particular uncontrolled redundancy causes consid-
erable additional maintenance costs for updating replicate data in (redundant)
databases.

e The challenge of privacy and security. Patients’ health data belong to the most sensi-
tive data about humans. For this reason, individual patient data must only be accessible
to those persons previously authorized by the patient. A health information system must
guarantee this claim which is called privacy of patient data. Likewise, the information
system has to ensure data security which comprises availability, confidentiality and
integrity of patient data.

In transinstitutional health information systems, the problem of heterogeneity can be esti-
mated even higher. Since these systems involve many originally autonomous information
systems, some additional challenges can be identified:

e The challenge of terminology. Having data stored in different databases (and without
a unique and comprehensive data model or data dictionary) at different sites, there is no
immediate need for a unified terminology and semantics. When starting to communi-
cate between these applications systems, this can, however, cause severe problems, and
an agreement on terminology for communicating information on diagnoses and proce-
dures is needed.
#40 4 Health Information Systems

o The challenge of stability. Down times of one or more computer-based application
systems with the consequence of significantly restricting care processes may be seldom,
but they exist. The same holds for problems in accessing the non-computer-based
record. But in a transinstitutional or even regional context, risk of instability is com-
paratively high.

eo The challenge of transinstitutional information management. Nowadays, in many
hospitals, the operational, tactical, and strategic information management is organized
professionally (see Sect. 9.3). Dedicated, specialized staff is taking care of the informa-
tion system. For information processing and storing within health care networks, there
is often no specific person or group being responsible and having authority to decide
and act.Example

4.6.1
Architecture of a Hospital Information System

Here is an extract of the description of the architecture of the hospital information system
of the Plétzberg Medical Center and Medical School (PMC). As mentioned, PMC is a ficti-
tious institution, which will be used in examples and exercises in this book.

The hospital information system of PMC enables the hospital functions of patient care
with patient admission, decision making and patient information, medical and nursing
care planning order entry, execution of diagnostic, therapeutic, and nursing procedures,
coding of diagnoses and procedures, patient discharge and transfer to other institutions.
In addition, supply and disposal management, scheduling and resource allocation, hospi-
tal administration, and hospital management are supported.

Those hospital functions are supported by some bigger and over a hundred smaller
application components (partly computer based, partly non-computer based). The most
important application component is the patient administration system, the computer-
based application component that supports patient admission and patient discharge and
transfer to other institutions. In addition, several computer-based departmental applica-
tion components are used for work organization and resource planning (e.g., in the radiol-
ogy department, in the laboratory department, and in outpatient units). Nearly all
computer-based application components are interconnected, using a communication
server. Some computer-based application components are isolated systems without
interfaces.

Non-computer-based application components are used for special documentation
purposes (e.g., documentation in operation rooms), and for order entry.
#47 Exercises 1

The application components are installed on physical data processing systems. As com-
puter-based physical data processing systems, approximately 40 application and database
servers are operated, and over 4,000 personal computers are used. Over 1,000 printers of
different types are installed. Most computer-based physical data processing systems are
interconnected by a high-speed communication network.

As non-computer-based physical data processing systems, over 2,000 telephones
and 800 pagers are used. About 1,500 different types of paper-based forms are used
to support different tasks. More than 400,000 patient records are created and used
each year, and a dozen local archives are responsible for patient record archiving. A
paper-based mailing system allows for non-computer-based communication between
departments.Exercises

47.1
Hospital Information System as a System

As introduced, a system can be defined as a set of people, things, and/or events together
with their relationships that forms an integrated whole. Which people, things, or events can
you find when looking at a hospital information system? In what relationship do they stand
to one another? To solve this exercise, take into account the components of hospital infor-
mation systems as defined in Sect. 3.3.3.

47.2
Buying a Hospital Information System

Look at the definition of hospital information systems in Sect. 4.2. Based on this definition,
is it possible to buy a hospital information system? Explain your answer. What do vendors
of hospital information systems thus really sell?Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

Patient-centered (not just institution-centered) care is obviously playing a major role.
Mention the challenges, which transinstitutional health information systems are facing.
Try to argue from your point of view, why these challenges are greater than the same ones
within one hospital.
#42 4 Health Information SystemsSummary

Information systems that are dealing with processing data, information, and knowledge in
health care environments are called health information systems.

Health information system can be differentiated as institutional health information sys-
tem, for example, hospital information systems, and transinstitutional health information
systems that span the borders of two or more legally separated institutions. Transinstitutional
health information systems play a vital role in supporting integrated care.

Important challenges of health information systems are:
the challenge of user acceptance,

the challenge of data redundancy,

the challenge of transcription,

the challenge of maintaining referential integrity,
the challenge of costs,

the challenge of privacy and security.

In transinstitutional health information systems, some additional challenges can be
identified:

o the challenge of terminology,

o the challenge of stability,

o the challenge of transinstitutional information management.

The electronic health record (EHR) is the collection of medical data relating to one patient
that is stored in the computer-based part of a health information system. EHRs are needed
to support functions of patient care as well as for administrative functions.
#Modeling Health Information SystemsIntroduction

Modeling HIS is an important precondition for their management: What we cannot
describe, we usually cannot manage adequately.

After defining the concepts necessary for dealing with this chapter, we will present
some types of information system models describing different aspects of HIS. We will then
focus on the so-called “three-layer graph-based metamodel” (3LGM?), which has been
developed for describing, evaluating and planning health information systems. 3LGM?
models and their application for information management will play an important role
throughout this book. Finally, we introduce reference models and a specific reference
model that facilitates modeling information systems in hospitals.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:
eo What are models, metamodels and reference models?

e What are typical metamodels for modeling various aspects of HIS?

® What is 3LGM??

e What are typical reference models for HIS?On Models and Metamodels

‘When dealing with systems in general and with HIS in particular, we need models of
systems.

#44 5 Modeling Health Information Systems

In the sciences, models commonly represent simplified depictions of reality or excerpts

of it. Models are adapted to answer certain questions or to solve certain tasks. Models

should be appropriate for the respective questions or tasks. This means that a model is

only “good” when it is able to answer such a question or solve such a task. For example,

a model that only comprises the patients (and not the nurses) of a ward cannot be used for

nurse staffing and shift planning. Since we are dealing with information management,

this means that models should present a simplified but appropriate view of a HIS in order

to support information management. Examples of respective questions to be answered

could be:

e Which hospital functions are supported by a HIS?

® Which information processing tools are used?

® What information is needed, if a patient shall be admitted to the hospital? What infor-
mation can be provided afterwards?

e What will happen if a specific server breaks down?

e How can the quality of information processing be judged?

The better a model assists its users, the better the model is. Thus, the selection of a model
depends on the problems or questions to be answered or solved.

A large number of different classes of models exists. Each class of models is deter-
mined by a certain metamodel. A metamodel can be understood as a language for con-
structing models of a certain class and a guideline for using the language.

Definition 5-2: Metamodel

A metamodel is a modeling framework, which consists of

e modeling syntax and semantics (the available modeling concepts together with their
meaning), i.e. the modeling language,

o the representation of the concepts (how the concepts are represented in a concrete
model, e.g., in a graphical way),

e and (sometimes) the modeling rules (e.g., the modeling steps), i.e. the guideline for
applying the language.

Just as different views on HIS exist, there also exist various metamodels. Typical types of

metamodels for HIS are:

e functional metamodels, focusing on hospital functions that are supported by the infor-
mation system;

e technical metamodels, which are used to build models describing the information pro-
cessing tools used;

® organizational metamodels, which are used to create models of the organizational struc-
ture of HIS;

e data metamodels, which are used for building models of the structure of data processed
and stored inside a HIS;
#5.2 On Models and Metamodels 45

® business process metamodels, which focus on the description of what is done in which
chronological and logical order;

e information system metamodels, which combine different metamodels into an inte-
grated, enterprise-wide view on information processing in an institution.

The art of HIS modeling is based on the right selection of a metamodel. Thus, for HIS

modeling, you should consider the following steps:

. Define the questions or tasks to be solved by the HIS model.

. Select an adequate metamodel.

. Gather the information needed for modeling.

. Create the model.

. Analyze and interpret the model (answer your questions).

. Evaluate if the right metamodel was chosen, that is, if the model was adequate to answer
the questions. If not, return to step 2.

5.2.2
Types of Models

Depending on the type of metamodel used, models can be arranged according to different
types.

5.2.2.1
Functional Models

Functional models represent the enterprise functions of an institution (what is to be done).
In a hospital, their elements are the hospital functions that are supported by the application
components of the hospital information system. The relationships of the hospital functions
can, for example, represent the information exchanged between them. In addition, enter-
prise functions are often described in a hierarchical way, comprising more global enter-
prise functions (such as patient administration) and more specific (refined) enterprise
functions (such as administrative discharge and billing).

Typical questions to be answered with functional models are:

e Which enterprise functions are relevant in a given institution?

e Which specific enterprise functions are part of which global enterprise functions?

e Which enterprise functions share the same data?

Typical representations of functional models are (hierarchical) lists of enterprise functions,
as well as graphical presentations. Table 5.1 presents an extract from a three-level hierar-
chy of hospital functions:

5.2.2.2
Technical Models

Technical models describe the information processing tools used. As concepts, they

typically provide physical data processing systems (e.g., computer systems, telephones,

forms, pagers, records) and application components. As relationships, they provide the

data transmission between physical data processing systems (e.g., network diagrams), or

the communication between application components.

Typical questions that can be answered with technical models are:

® Which information processing tools are used?

e Which application components communicate with each other?

eo What are the data transmission connections between the physical data processing
systems?

® What does the network technology look like?

e What technical solutions are used to guarantee the security and reliability of informa-
tion processing tools?

Technical models are typically presented as lists (e.g., lists of information processing tools
used) or as graphs (e.g., graph of the network architecture of computer systems). Examples
of graphical models are presented in Figs. 5.1 and 5.2.

5223
Organizational Models

Organizational models describe the organization of a unit or area. For example, they
may be used to describe the organizational structure of a hospital (e.g., consisting of

departments with inpatient and outpatient units). In the context of HIS, they are often
used to describe the organization of information management, that is, how it is organized
in order to support the goals of the hospital.

The concepts of those models are usually units or roles that stand in a certain organiza-
tional relationship to each other. Typical questions to be answered with organizational
models are:

e Which organizational units exist in a hospital?

e Which institutions are responsible for information management?

® Who is responsible for information management of a given area or unit?

Organizational models are typically represented as a list of organizational units (e.g., list
of the departments and sections in a hospital), or as a graph (e.g., graphical description of
the organizational relationships). An example is presented in Fig. 5.3.

5.2.2.4
Data Models

Data models describe the data processed and stored in an information system. Their con-
cepts are typically entity types (compare sect. 5.3.2.1) and their relationships. Typical
questions to be answered with data models are:

® What data are processed and stored in the information system?

e How are data elements related?

A typical metamodel for data modeling is offered by the class diagrams in the Unified
Modeling Language (UML).! An example is presented in Fig. 5.4.

5.2.2.5
Business Process Models

Business process models focus on a dynamic view of information processing. The con-

cepts used are activities and their chronological and logical order. Often, other concepts

are added, such as the role or unit that performs an activity, or the information processing

tools that are used. The following perspectives usually can be distinguished:

e Functional perspective: What activities are performed, and which data flows are needed
to link these activities?

® Behavioral perspective: When are activities performed, how are they performed, and
where are they performed? Do they use mechanisms such as loops and triggers? What
mechanisms trigger the start of the overall process?

® Organizational perspective: Where and by whom are activities being performed? Which
different roles participate in the activities?

e Informational perspective: Which entity types or entities (documents, data, products)
are being produced or manipulated? Which tools are used for this?

Typical questions to be answered with business process models are:

e Which activities are executed with regard to a given enterprise function?

e Who is responsible and which tools are used in a given process?

e Which activity is the pre- or postcondition for a given activity?

e What are the weak points of the given process and how can they be improved?

Due to the number of different perspectives, various business process metamodels exist.
Examples are metamodels for simple process chains, event-driven process chains, activity
diagrams, and Petri nets.

Simple process chains describe the (linear) sequence of process steps. They describe the
specific activities that form a process, in addition to the responsible role (e.g., a physician).
#50 5 Modeling Health Information Systems

Event-driven process chains add dynamic properties of process steps: events and logi-
cal operators (and, or, xor) are added to the enterprise functions, allowing the more com-
plex modeling of branching and alternatives. In addition, some instances of event-driven
process chains allow the addition of entity types (e.g., a chart).

Activity diagrams (as part of the modeling technique of the Unified Modeling Language,
UML) also describe the sequence of process steps, using activities, branching, conditions,
and entity types (Fig. 5.5). In addition, the method allows for splitting and synchronization

of parallel subprocesses.

Finally, Petri nets describe the dynamic properties of processes in a more formal way
than the other methods.*

5.2.26
Information System Models

Information system models comprise all modeling aspects discussed so far, that is, func-

tional modeling, technical modeling, organizational modeling, data modeling, and process

modeling. But beyond this, information system models consider the dependencies of these

models and, therefore, offer a more holistic view.

Typical questions to be answered with enterprise modeling are:

e Which hospital functions are supported by which information processing tools?

e Are the information processing tools sufficient to support the hospital functions?

e Is the communication among the application components sufficient to fulfill the infor-
mation needs?

e Which aims of the enterprise will be affected by a certain application component?

e In which area of the institution are specific data on specific objects used?A Metamodel for Modeling Health Information Systems on Three Layers: 3LGM*

Let us now introduce a specific information system metamodel for modeling health infor-
mation systems. This metamodel is called the three-layer graph-based metamodel (3LGM?2).
It aims to support the systematic management of HIS and especially the structural quality
assessment of information processing in health care institutions. We will use this meta-
model further on in this book.

Typical questions to be answered with models derived from the 3LGM? metamodel are:
‘Which hospital functions are supported?

‘Which information is needed or updated when performing a hospital function?

‘Which application components are used, and how do they communicate?

‘Which physical data processing systems are used?

‘Which hospital functions are supported by which application component?

Which application components are installed on which physical data processing
systems?

e What is the overall architecture of the hospital information system?

3LGM? combines functional, technical, organizational, and some aspects of business pro-
cess metamodels. It is represented in UML notation. As the name indicates, the 3LGM?
distinguishes three layers of information systems:

e domain layer;

® logical tool layer;

® physical tool layer.

“Mortensen KH, Christensen S, editors. Petri Nets World. http://www.daimi.au.dk/PetriNets
#52 5 Modeling Health Information Systems

There are three variants of the 3LGM?: 3LGM?-B, 3LGM?-M and 3LGM?-S. The main
difference between the variants is the provision of different concepts for describing the
communication between application components in an information system. 3LGM?>-B,
which is the basis for 3LGM2-M and 3LGM?-§, consists of concepts describing basic ele-
ments of a HIS architecture. 3LGM?-M extends 3LGM2-B by concepts for modeling mes-
sage-based communication. For architectures in which computer-based application
components provide services to be used by other computer-based application components
(so-called service-oriented architectures), the concepts of 3LGM?2-S are useful for
modeling.

The following sections provide the theoretical background for the further use of 3LGM?
in this book. Section 5.3.1 introduces those UML concepts needed for understanding the
description of 3LGM? in UML notation. Section 5.3.2 explains 3LGM2-B with its basic
concepts of the three layers of 3LGM2. Sections 5.3.3 and 5.3.4 introduce the additional
concepts of 3LGM2-M and 3LGM?-S.

5.3.1
UML Class Diagrams for the Description of 3LGM?

The metamodel 3LGM? is formalized with the help of class diagrams according to the
Unified Modeling Language (UML). For a more thorough understanding of UML, you
may refer to a respective textbook, but the necessary basics are explained in this section.

3LGM? class diagrams consist of classes, abstract classes and associations between
classes.

Every 3LGM? concept is described by a class. Classes contain the attributes and
methods of a set of similar entities. Every class is given an unambiguous class name.
For example, computer-based application component is a class of the 3LGM? meta-
model. In a concrete 3LGM? model, we use instances of classes for modeling. A patient
administration system could be an instance of the class computer-based application
component.

As introduced in Sect. 3.3.3, both computer-based application components and non-
computer-based application components are application components. In 3LGM?2, we
therefore refer to application component as an abstract class, because we can build no
instances of application component in a concrete model. Instead, we have to use its
3LGM? subclasses computer-based application component or non-computer-based app-
lication components for building instances. The names of abstract classes are written in
italics in UML class diagrams; arrows relate the subclasses to the abstract class
(see Fig. 5.0).

Associations link classes. For example, application component is linked with compo-
nent interface by the association “has” in 3LGM? (see Sect. 5.3.2.2). Associations are
represented by lines between classes and are often named. At the two ends of an associa-
tion line, the multiplicity specifies how many instances of a class can be linked with how
many instances of the opposite class (see Fig. 5.7).

If it is necessary to specify an association by attributes or by associations to other
classes, an association class is used (see Fig. 5.8). In 3LGM?, we use for example the
#5.3 AMetamodel for Modeling Health Information Systems on Three Layers: 3LGM? 53

association class ‘support’ to further specify the relationships between enterprise functions
and application components (see Sect. 5.3.2.4).

In the 3LGM? metamodel, we often use associations between one class and itself in
order to be able to sub- or superordinate certain instances of this class. For example, both

the operation theatre with room number OP1 and the building B123 are instances of the
same class of locations in a certain hospital. But since room OP1 is located in B123 it can
be subordinated to that building. In a similar but not identical way the enterprise function
‘execution of radiological procedures’ can be subordinated to execution of diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures.

As these examples show, it is helpful to distinguish between two different meanings of
subordination in 3LGM? models: decomposition and specialization.

Decompositions describe part-of relationships as with OP1 and B123. The respective
superordination is called a composition. See Fig. 5.9 for its description in a UML class
diagram.

Specializations describe refinement relationships as with ‘execution of radiological
procedures’ in comparison to execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The
respective superordination is called generalization. See Fig. 5.10 to understand how this is
described in a UML class diagram. In specializations, attribute values of the superordi-
nated instance are inherited to the subordinated instance. For example, if execution of
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures is supported by a certain computer-based applica-
tion component X, then ‘execution of radiological procedures’ is also considered to be
supported by X since it is actually just one special way of execution of diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures.

53.2.1
Domain Layer

The domain layer of 3LGM? describes what kinds of activities in a health care institution
are enabled by its information system and what kind of data should be stored and pro-
cessed. This layer is independent of the implemented information processing tools.

There are myriads of physical or virtual objects in a health care institution (e.g., patient
John Doe, or epicrisis of patient Jane Smith dated from 2010-06-10). Data represent
information about those objects and are the values of attributes of the objects. Objects
being similar with respect to their attribute categories are summarized as object classes
(e.g., class patient as set of all objects which are human beings and receive care in a health
care institution).

Definition 5-3: Entity type

An entity type is a representation of

1. an object class and of

2. the data representing information concerning the objects of this object class, if these
data are stored or could or should be stored in the information system.

‘We use the label of an object class as term for the respective entity type. For the sake of
simplicity we say “data about an entity type” if we think about the data being represented
by the entity type.

For example an entity type patient represents

o the class of all patients in a certain hospital and

o the data describing these patients like their name, birthday, home address, social secu-
rity number, height, weight etc. as it is stored in a certain information system.

Note, that we must not confuse the entity type with the respective object class and the data
describing its objects. The entity type is only their representation or surrogate in an infor-
mation system’s model.

Information processing activities at a certain time and place in an information system
use certain data in order to update or delete other data. Using the concept entity type we
can say, that an activity interprets data about certain entity types and updates data of certain
entity types. Again simplifying we say that the activity interprets entity types and updates
entity types.

If we look at enterprise functions as introduced in Sect. 3.3.3 and focus on their infor-
mation processing aspects, we can then define them formally as follows:

Definition 5-4: Enterprise function

The class of all activities interpreting the same set of entity types and updating the same
set of entity types is called an information processing enterprise function (short: enterprise
function). An enterprise function is a directive in an institution on how to interpret data
#56 5 Modeling Health Information Systems

about entity types and then update data about entity types as a consequence of this
interpretation. The goal of data interpretation and updates is part of or contributes to (sub)
goals of the institution. A function has no definitive beginning or end.

Similar to an activity, an enterprise function is said to interpret entity types and update
entity types.

For example, if Dr. Doe plans clinical care for her patient Smith this morning (i.e. an
activity), this will result in interpreting data about Smith’s diagnoses and the hospital’s
clinical pathways and then updating data about concrete plans for medical or nursing pro-
cedures. The class of all similar activities of all doctors and nurses may be called medical
and nursing care planning and is an enterprise function of a hospital. The enterprise func-
tion contributes significantly to the hospital’s goal of treating patients and updates the
entity types medical procedure and nursing procedure depending on the interpreted entity
types diagnosis and clinical pathway.

Enterprise functions and entity types can be structured hierarchically by specializa-
tion and decomposition. When an enterprise function or an entity type is specialized,
all its subelements are a further refinement of the enterprise function or the entity type
and independent of the respective superelement. For an enterprise function it means
that the activities regarding this enterprise function are executed differently in differ-
ent contexts. The enterprise function execution of diagnostic procedures, for example,
has different specializations in different diagnostic departments. Similarly, an entity
type can have different forms for slightly different purposes: A finding from a radiol-
ogy department is different from a finding from a laboratory; but both are specializa-
tions of findings, which is the generalized term. By contrast, when an enterprise
function or an entity type is decomposed, all its subelements form a proper subset of
the enterprise function or the entity type. An activity regarding an enterprise function
is only completed if all activities regarding all its decomposed subfunctions are com-
pleted. For example, the activities regarding patient admission are only completed if
among others administrative admission, medical admission and nursing admission
have been performed. A decomposed entity type is only complete when all its subordi-
nate entity types are available. A patient history, for example, must contain all clinical
data about a patient, including medical and nursing anamnesis, findings, discharge
summary etc.

Interpreting and updating relationships between enterprise functions and entity types
are inherited to their subelements, no matter whether the enterprise functions or entity
types were decomposed or specialized.

Enterprise functions are performed in certain organizational units of health care institu-
tions. Organizational units like a radiology department can be decomposed, but not
specialized.

Definition 5-5: Organizational unit
An organizational unit is a part of an institution which can be defined by
responsibilities.
#5.3 AMetamodel for Modeling Health Information Systems on Three Layers: 3LGM? 57

Note that enterprise functions, entity types, and organizational units are just part of a
static view of a hospital. However, so-called information processes can be modeled by
bringing enterprise functions, which interpret and update entity types, into a logical and
chronological order.

Definition 5-6: Information process
An information process is a logical and chronological sequence of enterprise func-
tions which interpret or update data about entities.

In contrast to most business process models (see Sect. 5.2.2.5), information processes
do not contain a behavioral perspective.

The concepts introduced here and their mutual associations are illustrated in Fig. 5.11
by using UML as explained in Sect. 5.3.1.

A graphical representation of enterprise functions and entity types on the domain
layer is shown in Fig. 5.12 where enterprise functions are represented as rectangles and
entity types are represented as ovals. An arrow from an entity type to an enterprise func-
tion represents an interpreting access, from an enterprise function to an entity type an
updating access. Dashed arrows point from decomposed elements towards their compo-
sition. This may also be illustrated by positioning decomposed elements on or into their
composition. Arrows with empty heads point from specialized elements to their
generalization.

‘Which entity types and which enterprise functions of an information system are mod-
eled, depends on the health care institution and on the modeling purpose. Reference mod-
els may offer recommendations about important entity types and enterprise functions for
certain kinds of hospitals (see Sects. 5.4 and 5.5).

53.2.2
Logical Tool Layer

At the logical tool layer (UML metamodel, Fig. 5.13), application components (see
Sect. 3.3.3.) are the center of interest.

Definition 5-7: Application component

An application component is a set of actually usable rules, which control data pro-
cessing of certain physical data processing systems. Rules are considered to be actually
usable, if they are implemented such that they are ready to support certain enterprise
functions in a certain enterprise or support communication between application
components.

If the rules are implemented as executable software, the application component is called
computer-based application component. Otherwise it is called non-computer-based.

Application components, either computer-based or non-computer-based, support enter-
prise functions. A software product is a set of rules, represented by software being stored
at a certain medium but not implemented and actually executable yet. This is what we can
buy. A computer-based application component cannot be bought in a shop anyway but has

to be constructed by customizing a buyable software product onsite. Non-computer-based
application components (synonym: organizational systems) are controlled by conventional
rules, which can be summarized as working plans describing how people use non-
computer-based data processing systems (see Sect. 3.3.3.).

Application components are responsible for the storage and for the communication of
data about certain entity types. Application components use communication interfaces for
the communication among each other. A communication interface can either send or
receive data about entity types. For communication among application components, com-
munication links can be defined. A communication link connects a communication inter-
face of one application component with a communication interface of another application
component and communicates data about a certain entity type. Application components
have to communicate by respective use of their interfaces to ensure that enterprise func-
tions can interpret and update entity types as described at the domain layer. Application
components may be decomposed.

Application components of an information system are objects, which actually can be
experienced by staff members in an institution. But nevertheless, they are not tangible.
Therefore, we refer to application components also as logical tools. Consequently, we call
the layer describing the application components the logical tool layer. This is in contrast to
the tangible tools, which we refer to as physical (see Sect. 5.3.2.3).

arrows represents the direction of the communication. Names of software products being
used for a computer-based application component are put in parentheses.

53.2.3
Physical Tool Layer

The physical tool layer (UML metamodel, Fig. 5.15) is a set of physical data processing
systems.

Definition 5-8: Physical data processing system

A physical data processing system is a physically touchable object or a simulated
physically touchable object being able to receive, store, forward, or purposefully manip-
ulate data. We denote receiving, storing, forwarding and purposeful manipulation of data
as data processing. This data processing is controlled by rules.

The rules mentioned here are identical to those mentioned in the definition of an applica-
tion component.

Physical data processing systems can even be human actors (such as persons delivering
mail), non-computer-based physical tools (such as printed forms, telephones, books, paper-
based patient records, administrative stickers), or computer systems (such as terminals,
servers, personal computers, switches, routers).

Physical data processing systems like a specific server or a specific personal computer
can be assigned to a tool class (e.g., server, personal computer) and a location. Physical
data processing systems are physically connected via so-called data transmission connec-
tions (e.g., communication network, courier service) which can use different transmitting
media. A transmitting medium is either signal-based (e.g., copper cable, optical fiber) or
non-signal-based (e.g., sheet of paper, CD-ROM, memory stick).

Physical data processing systems can be refined by decomposition (see Sect. 5.3.1). A
physical data processing system can be part of exactly one physical data processing system.

Additionally, physical data processing systems can be virtualized. We speak of virtual-
ization when, either, one or more physical data processing systems simulate one physical
data processing system, or one physical data processing simulates one or more physical
data processing systems. In the first case, we call the simulated physical data processing
system a cluster. In the latter case, we call the simulated physical data processing systems
virtual machines. In a cluster, for example, different servers could, depending on their
capacity, alternatively run a certain computer-based application component. However, the
cluster can be administrated as one (virtual) server. By contrast, with the help of virtual
machines, different operating systems or different instances of one operating system can
be run on one physical server, for example. Both virtual machines and clusters are called
virtual physical data processing systems, since they can be used as physical data process-
ing systems for example to implement application components, but are not physical in the
sense of being touchable physically. See Fig. 5.16 for the representation of virtualization
in 3LGM? models.

between physical data processing systems are depicted as lines. The figure also shows
decompositions, virtual machines and clusters. Information about locations and tool classes
is not represented graphically.

53.2.4
Interlayer Relationships

A variety of dependencies, called interlayer relationships, exist among components of differ-
ent layers. Relationships exist between concepts of the domain layer and the logical tool layer
and between concepts of the logical tool layer and the physical tool layer (see Fig. 5.18).
Considering the domain layer and the logical tool layer, the most important relation-
ships are between enterprise functions and application components. These relationships
are handled by the class use and the association class support in 3LGM2 If a computer-
based application component is used for a certain enterprise function there are two possi-
bilities. Either the computer-based application component is immediately used for
supporting the activities regarding an enterprise function (class use), or the computer-
based application component only mediates the use of another computer-based application
component which supports the enterprise function (class support). The answers to the

Fig. 5.17 Example of a 3LGM? physical tool layer

following two questions help to understand how to assign enterprise functions to applica-

tion components.

eo Which application components are necessary to support an enterprise function
completely?
In a 3LGM? model, we specialize or decompose enterprise functions to that level of
detail needed to describe the support of the enterprise functions by single application
components. That means, if we think of the hierarchy of enterprise functions in a
3LGM? model as a tree in graph theory, then each of the tree’s “leaf functions” must
completely be supported by one application component of the information system. We
only assign application components to the “leaf functions” of the tree. For example, if
we find that the enterprise function medical and nursing care planning needs joint sup-
port of two application components X and Y, we have to specialize or decompose the
enterprise function in a way, that the resulting subfunctions are supported by X and Y
respectively. If X is used by clinicians and Y is used by nurses it could be a solution to
decompose the enterprise function into ‘medical care planning” and ‘nursing care plan-
ning’. If X is used in department D1 and Y in department D2, a specialization into
‘medical and nursing care planning in D1” and ‘medical and nursing care planning in
D2’ could be a solution. The next paragraph will help to identify the example’s latter
case as a functional redundancy which might not be expressed by specializing clinical
and nursing care planning but by assigning D1 and D2 as alternative/redundant appli-
cation components supporting the enterprise function.

e Which possible alternatives are there to support an enterprise function?

An enterprise function F is sometimes supported alternatively by more than one appli-
cation component. That means, no matter if one of these application components fails,
enterprise function F can still be performed. In this case, we have a functional redun-
dancy which may be an indication for superfluous application components. However,
as one application component often supports a variety of enterprise functions which in
turn can also be supported by a variety of application components, it is quite compli-
cated to determine an information system’s set of redundant application components
which could be shut down without losing the support of any enterprise function.
Section 8.7.4. provides a deeper understanding of functional redundancy, its calcula-
tion and its effects on health information systems.

Further relationships between classes of the domain layer and classes of the logical tool

layer regard entity types (compare Fig. 5.13):

e At the logical tool layer, application components, both computer-based and non-
computer-based, can store data about entity types. If an entity type E is updated by an
enterprise function and this entity type’s data are stored in an application component,
we call this combination the ‘documentation of entity type E’.

e For every entity type E can be stated whether an application component storing data
about E is master for E and, therefore, in case of redundant data storage, contains the
‘original’ data about that entity type. ‘Original’ means that data about E stored in other
application components have to be considered as copies of the ‘original’ data.
Consequently, only data in master application components can be updated directly by
users; data integrity in the other application components has to be maintained by send-
ing new copies of the original data to these non-master application components (for
details see Sect. 6.5.5.2).

e Additionally, entity types can be related to communication links and interfaces in order
to express their ability to send or receive data about these entity types.

Between the logical tool layer and the physical tool layer, there exist two relationships
which link application components and physical data processing systems. One of these
relationships states that an application component needs physical data processing systems
to be able to provide its features. For example, a certain computer-based application com-
ponent has to be installed on a certain server to make its features available. Furthermore,
if application components store entity types, they need physical data processing systems
that can store data. Thus, the second relationship between application components and
physical data processing systems expresses that an application component needs physical
data processing systems for storage.

Figure 5.19 combines Figs. 5.12, 5.14 and 5.17 in order to illustrate the different
interlayer relations mentioned before. Note that relationships between entity types and
application components or communication links and interfaces are not represented
graphically.
#66 5 Modeling Health Information Systems

Fig. 5.19 Example of three 3LGM? layers and their interlayer relationships3LGM*M

In addition to the concepts of 3LGM2-B, the variant 3LGM?2-M provides the new concepts
message type and communication standard for modeling message-based communication at
the logical tool layer (compare Fig. 5.20).

A message is a set of data that are arranged as a unit in order to be communicated
between application components. A message type describes a class of uniform messages
and determines which data about which entity types is communicated by a message belong-
ing to this message type. That means, in the 3LGM2-M metamodel there is a connection
between message types and entity types expressing that messages of this type communi-
cate data about these entity types. In contrast to 3LGM2-B, message types, but not the
entity types themselves, are used to describe, what data are communicated over sending
interfaces, communication links and receiving interfaces.

A message type can belong to a communication standard and a communication standard
is used to group message types. In general, communication standards describe how
messages of a certain data format are communicated when a certain event occurs. In
medical informatics, HL7 and DICOM are well-known examples for communication
standards (see Sect. 6.5.4 for details). In 3LGM2-M, we do not model events.3LGM*S

3LGM=S is suitable for modeling service-oriented architectures (see Sect. 6.5.5.3). It
extends 3LGM?2-B by the new concepts ‘service’ and ‘service class’, and replaces the con-
cepts ‘sending interface’ and ‘receiving interface’ by ‘providing interface’ and ‘invoking
interface’ at the logical tool layer (compare Fig. 5.21).

As in 3LGM?-B and 3LGM2-M, we proceed on the assumption that an application com-
ponent implements certain features which are functionalities directly contributing to the
fulfillment of one or more enterprise functions. Thus, we define service the following way.

Definition 5-9: Service
A service is a feature provided by an application component in order to be used by
other application components.

If we want to express that some services are of similar type, we can summarize them in a
service class.

As their names imply, providing interfaces and invoking interfaces, each belonging to
only one application component, are able to provide or to invoke services.On Reference Models

Until now we talked about HIS metamodels, that is, about languages to describe health
information systems from various views. To support HIS modeling, modelers often ask for
examples of models of typical HIS realized by one of the typical metamodels mentioned
in Sect. 5.2.1 They would like to use them as a pattern which can be customized to the
specific situation he or she has to model. We call this kind of models reference models.
#5.4 On Reference Models 69

According to the type of metamodel used, a reference model supports the construction of
models of a certain class of systems and helps to deal with a certain class of questions or
tasks concerning these systems.

Definition 5-10: Reference Model
A model is called a reference model for a certain class of systems and a certain class

of questions or tasks dealing with these systems, if it provides model patterns

supporting

o the derivation of more specific models through modifications, limitations, or
completions (generic reference models) or

e direct comparison of different models with the reference model concerning certain
quality aspects of the modeled systems (e.g., completeness, styles of system’s
architecture) (nongeneric reference models).

A specific model may be considered a variant of a generic reference model developed
through specialization (modifications, limitations, or completions). This variant is an
instance of the metamodel that also underlies the corresponding reference model. For
example, a model of the processes in a hospital information system of a specific hospital
may be derived from a general reference model on HIS processes. Both the specific model
and the used reference model are instances of the same business process metamodel.

A reference model should be followed by a description of its usage, for example, how
specific models can be derived from the reference model, or how it can be used for the
purpose of comparison.

Specific models can be compared with a reference model, and consequently models can
also be compared with each other, judging their similarity or difference when describing
certain aspects.

For example, business reference models describe models of processes, data, and orga-
nization of a certain class of institutions (e.g., hospitals). They deal with information
processing in these institutions.

If such a reference model focuses on the processes in the institution, it will be based on
a business process metamodel (see Sect. 5.2.2.5) and can be called a business process
reference model. If it focuses on the data and their types and relationships it will be based
on a data metamodel (see Sect. 5.2.2.4) and can be called a data reference model. The
exemplary data model outlined in Fig. 5.4 can be used as a data reference model.

Reference models can be normative in the sense that they are broadly accepted and have
practical relevance. Reference models are more likely to be accepted if they are not only reli-
able and well-tested, but also recommended by a respected institution. For example, the ini-
tiative Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (THE) (see Sect. 6.5.4.6) provides acomprehensive
set of models describing how to use communication standards like HL7 and DICOM in typi-
cal health care settings. These models can be regarded as reference models. Actually many
experts in the field use these reference models like norms or standards, although they are
explicitly not. Obviously they became normative because they are widely used especially in
commercial invitations of tenders for software supporting radiology departments.
#70 5 Modeling Health Information SystemsA Reference Model for the Domain Layer of Hospital Information Systems

As the identification and modeling of adequate enterprise functions and entity types for a
hospital is rather time- and consequently cost-intensive, a functional reference model for
the domain layer of hospital information systems was developed”. It consists of hierarchi-
cally structured sets of hospital functions and entity types. The reference model focuses on
the activities in patient care. Thus, the main enterprise function is patient care, and there
are maintenance functions supporting patient care like supply management, scheduling
and resource allocation, hospital administration, hospital management and research and
teaching (compare Fig. 5.22).

Furthermore, in that reference model the enterprise functions bear a relation to each
other by entity types which they can update or interpret. For defining entity types within
the reference model of the domain layer the Health Level 7 Reference Information Model®
(HL7-RIM) had been used.

The Reference Model for the Domain Layer of Hospital Information Systems is avail-
able as a 3LGM? model’ and can for this reason be immediately used for modeling hospital
information systems. Following the definition of reference models in sect. 5.4 the Reference
Model of the Domain Layer can be used as a model pattern for the domain layer of hospital
information systems and, additionally, can help to compare hospital information systems
by means of a uniform terminology used for the domain layer. That is, for each enterprise
function of the Reference Model of the Domain Layer the support by application compo-
nents in different information systems can be determined.

The Reference Model for the Domain Layer of Hospital Information Systems is used as
a basis for describing entity types and enterprise functions throughout this book. Thus
Sect. 6.3, which introduces the enterprise functions of a hospital, follows the structure of
that reference model and all examples concerning entity types and enterprise functions are
taken from it.Exercises

5.6.1
Typical Implementation of Hospital Functions

Look at the hospital functions presented in Fig. 5.22 and describe how they are imple-
mented in your hospital. Try to classify each hospital function according to how it is typi-
cally supported by application components, which are

e non-computer-based,

e computer-based,

e or a mix of computer-based and non-computer-based application components.

If in your hospital a hospital function is supported by a mix of computer-based and
non-computer-based application components, find out what subfunction is supported
by computer-based application components and what subfunction is supported by
non-computer-based application components.

5.6.2
3LGM? as a Metamodel

3LGM? is a metamodel. Look at the definition of metamodels in Sect. 5.2.1 and find the
various concepts in the 3LGM? (e.g., for modeling syntax and semantics, representation,
and modeling rules).

5.6.3
Modeling with 3LGM?

The following description of a sub-information system of a hospital is given:

Patient admission is supported by an application component called PATADMIN, which is
installed at the hospital's central server. The administration personnel work with two per-
sonal computers. The patient data are stored in the Oracle-based medical database system
(MEDDB). After the patient admission is completed, patient data are transmitted to the
computer-based application components at the laboratory department (LABSYS) and at
the radiology department (RADSYS). For communication with paper-based application
components, i.e., for ordering or clinical documentation, labels containing the identifying
patient data as text and as barcodes are printed.

5.6.3.1
HIS Components

Identify the 3LGM?2-relevant components of the described HIS and assign them to one of
the three layers and use the correct 3LGM? terms. Which necessary information to get a
complete model of this sub-information system is missing?

5.6.3.2
Create the Model

Design a 3LGM? model® with the three layers that includes the components and their
relationships.

5.6.3.3
Interlayer Relationships

Describe which interlayer relationships are given and add them to the model.

5.6.3.4
New Enterprise Function

Add the enterprise function execution of nursing procedures to the 3LGM? model of our
example. In this example, nurses use paper-based forms to document their activities. The
non-computer-based organization system ‘Nursing Documentation System’ describes how

from http://www.3lgm?2.de/en/ (English) or www.3lgm?2.de (German). At this website you can
also find all 3LGM? models used in this book.
#5.7 Summary 73

the nurses have to document and which forms have to be used. This enterprise function
mainly requires general patient data, which are printed on labels and stuck to the forms,
and nursing knowledge. It results in information about executed nursing procedures. Add
the necessary elements in all three layers of the graphical model.Summary

HIS models are used to support the description, management, and operation of HIS. A
good model adequately supports information managers in these tasks.

According to their different purposes, different metamodels (modeling languages) exist
for HIS. This leads, for example, to functional models, technical models, organizational
models, data models, business process models, and information system models.

The art of HIS modeling is based on the right selection of a metamodel with respect to
the tasks to be supported and the questions to be answered.

A typical metamodel for modeling health information systems is the three-layer graph-
based metamodel (3LGM?). It is used to describe the static view of a HIS over three layers:
the domain layer, the logical tool layer, and the physical tool layer.

The domain layer describes a hospital independent of its implementation by its enter-
prise functions and the interpreted and updated entity types. At the logical tool layer, appli-
cation components are described that support the hospital functions. The physical tool
layer comprises a set of physical data processing systems that support the application
components.

There are several relationships between classes of the different layers. Enterprise func-
tions are related to their supporting application components; entity types are related to
storing application components and to communication links. Updating an entity type when
performing an enterprise function and storing it afterwards in an application component is
called documentation. The application components are related to the physical data pro-
cessing systems on which they are implemented.

Reference models are specific models that provide model patterns. They can be used to
derive concrete models or to compare models. A typical reference model for hospital func-
tions is the Reference Model for the Domain Layer of Hospital Information Systems,
which provides a thorough set of patterns for modeling entity types and enterprise
functions.
##Architecture of Hospital Information
SystemsIntroduction

After having introduced health information systems in general we will at first turn our
attention to hospital information systems (HIS). According to our previous definition of
health information systems a HIS is the socio-technical subsystem of a hospital which
comprises all information processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in
their respective information processing roles.

‘We now take a closer look at what HIS look like. We will do that rather synthetically.
This means that we will first look at all the detailed components a HIS consists of and
afterwards we will explain step by step how these components can be synthesized, that is,
assembled in order to achieve what users nowadays experience as the HIS.

Therefore we start by discussing the kind of data that has to be processed in hospitals
and then present hospital functions that interpret or update these data. We introduce typical
information processing tools and typical architectures first at the logical and then at the
physical tool layer of HIS. At each layer we explain how these tools can be assembled and
integrated for the better support of users.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:
e What kind of data has to be processed in hospitals?

‘What are the main hospital functions?

‘What are the typical information processing tools in hospitals?

‘What are the different architectures of a HIS?

How can integrity and integration be achieved within a HIS?Domain Layer: Data to Be Processed in Hospitals

Since the HIS is that subsystem of the hospital dealing with processing of information — or
more precisely processing of data — we first want to introduce the kind of data that are typical
for hospitals. As explained in Sect. 5.3.2.1 we can express “kind of data” by entity types.

Domain Layer: Hospital Functions

In the previous section, we introduced different entity types which represent object types
and the respective data typically processed and stored in HIS. We will now elucidate how
and where data about these entity types are processed in hospitals. As explained in Sects.
3.3.3 and 5.3.2.1 we use enterprise functions to summarize classes of information-process-
ing activities. And since we focus on hospitals, we call them hospital functions here. These
hospital functions can also be considered as representatives of processes.

‘We will present hospital functions and their interpreted and updated entity types in greater
detail, but we will not (yet) focus on how they are typically supported by various computer-
based or non-computer-based information-processing tools. For the hospital functions the
interpreted and updated entity types will be outlined graphically in respective figures.

After this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What are the main hospital functions that have to be supported by a HIS?

e What information is interpreted or updated by hospital functions?

e Which functional aspects have to be considered when implementing information-pro-
cessing tools?

e What are examples for hospital processes?

6.3.1
Patient Care

6.3.1.1
Patient Admission

Patient admission (short: admission) aims at recording and distributing the patient demo-
graphics and insurance data as well as medical and nursing data of the patient history (see
Fig. 6.1). In addition, each patient must be correctly identified, and a unique patient and
case identifier must be assigned.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.2):

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 81

Appointment Scheduling

The hospital must be able to schedule an appointment for a patient’s visit. In addition,
unplanned patient admissions must be possible (e.g., in case of emergencies).

Patient Identification and Checking for Recurrent

A unique patient identification number (PIN) must be assigned to each patient. This PIN
should be valid and unchangeable lifelong (i.e., the PIN should not be based on changeable

patient’s attributes such as the name) (see also Sect. 6.5.2.1). The PIN is the main precondi-
tion for a patient-oriented combination of all information arising during previous, recent, as
well as future hospitalizations. Before a PIN can be assigned, the patient must be correctly
identified, usually based on a health insurance card and on available administrative patient
master information (such as name and date of birth). If the patient has already been in the
hospital, he or she must be identified as recurrent, and previously documented information
must be made available (such as previous diagnoses and therapies). If the patient is in the
hospital for the first time, a new PIN must be assigned. In addition, the hospital must be able
to distinguish different cases or hospital stays of a patient. Therefore, in addition to the PIN,

a case identification number (CIN) is usually assigned (see administrative admission).

Administrative Admission

Administrative admission starts following patient identification. It creates a so-called case,
being the aggregation of several contacts, clustered according to specific clinical and/or
organizational purposes of the hospital. In case of inpatient treatment, a case summarizes
the hospital stay from patient admission until discharge. Each case is uniquely identified
by its CIN. Important administrative data such as insurance data, details about special
services, patient’s relatives, admitting physician, and transfer diagnoses must be recorded.
The patient is assigned to a ward and a bed. Some of the administrative data must be avail-
able to other hospital functions through the help of certain organization media (such as
labels and magnetic cards; see Fig. 6.3). Administrative data form the backbone of infor-
mation processing. In case of changes, patient data must be maintained and communi-
cated. If the admitting physician has communicated relevant information (e.g., previous
laboratory findings), this information must be communicated to the responsible physician
in the hospital. Administrative admission is usually done either in a central patient admis-
sion area or directly on the ward (e.g., during emergencies or on the weekend).

Even in emergencies patient admission is necessary. At least patient identification and
checking for recurrent has to be performed in order to assign a proper PIN and CIN. In these
cases a short version of administrative admission may be applicable. If the patient is uncon-
scious and does not bear an identity card, only a dummy name may be recorded to provide
PIN and CIN. It will be no problem to replace the dummy name by the correct name later.
#82 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 83

Medical Admission

Subsequently, the responsible physician will carry out the medical admission. This typi-
cally comprises the patient history (disease history, systems review, social history, past
medical history, family history, medication). Some of this information may be collected
from documents of the referring physician and is taken to the hospital by the patient him-
self or herself.

As a result of medical admission the admission diagnosis has to be stated and to be
coded according to ICD10 (see Sect. 6.5.3.2).

The basic patient history data have to be made available for other hospital functions.
For the patient history there may also be department-specific, (semi-)standardized data
entry forms available. The collected information should be available during the whole stay.
Medical admission is usually done at the ward.

Nursing Admission

The responsible nurse will proceed with the nursing admission. This typically comprises
the introduction of the patient to the ward and the nursing history. Administrative data and
the reason of hospitalization are already at her or his disposal. For the nursing history there
may be computer-based or department-specific, (semi-)standardized data entry forms
available. These may contain information about the current diagnosis and therapy, orienta-
tion, communication ability, social contacts, nutrition, mobility, personal hygiene, and
vital signs. The collected information should be available during the whole stay. Nursing
admission is usually done at the ward.

Visitor and Information Service

The hospital management must always have an overview of the recent bed occupation, that
is, about the patients staying at the hospital. This is, for example, important for the clerks
at the information desk, who must be able to inform relatives and visitors correctly (see
Fig. 6.4), and also for some general hospital management statistics.

6.3.1.2
Decision Making, Planning, and Organization of Patient Treatment

All clinical procedures of health care professionals must be discussed, agreed upon, effi-
ciently planned, and initiated. This process is repeated each time new information is
available.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.5):

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 85

Decision Making and Patient Information

Responsible team members must decide upon the next steps such as certain diagnostic
or therapeutic procedures. Depending on the complexity of a diagnostic or therapeutic
decision, they should be able to consult internal or external experts (e.g., in special-
ized hospitals) to get a second opinion. In this context, (tele-)conferences may help.
Staff members must be able to access all relevant patient data specific to a situation, in
addition to general clinical knowledge (e.g., guidelines and standards) supporting
patient care. Medication prescription may be supported by providing knowledge about
adverse drug events. Decisions about clinical procedures must be documented. The
patient should be involved in the decision-making process, the consequences of the
planned diagnostic or therapeutic procedures should be explained, and his or her
informed consent must be documented as well. Decision making is a permanent enter-
prise function which is triggered by new information about the patient.

Medical and Nursing Care Planning

The next steps now have to be planned in detail. For each medical procedure (such as
a radiological examination, an operation, or a chemotherapeutic treatment) as well as
for each nursing procedure, the type, extent, duration, and responsible person have to
be determined. In nursing, care planning is documented in nursing care plans, contain-
ing nursing problems, nursing goals, and planned nursing procedures (Fig. 6.6). If

Fig. 6.6 Paper-based nursing documentation on a ward
#86 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

necessary, other health care professionals are ordered to execute the planned clinical
procedures (e.g., medical bandaging orders, which have to be executed by a nurse).

Care planning in cancer treatment is often performed in tumor board reviews. This
means that a number of physicians who are experts in different specialties (disciplines)
review and discuss the medical condition and treatment options of a patient.

6.3.1.3
Order Entry

Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures must often be ordered at specialized service units
(e.g., laboratory, radiology, or pathology). These units execute the ordered procedures and
communicate the findings or results back to the ordering department.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.7):

Preparation of an Order

Depending on the type of order, specimens that must be unambiguously assigned to a
patient are submitted (e.g., blood sample). Depending on the available service spectrum
offered by a service unit, which may be presented in the form of service catalogs, the health
care professional selects the appropriate service on an order entry form (Fig. 6.8). Patient
and case identification, together with relevant information such as recent diagnoses, rele-
vant questions, service ordered (e.g., laboratory, radiology), and other comments (e.g., on
special risks), are documented. An order should be initiated only by authorized persons.

‘When computer-based tools for order entry are used, computerized decision support systems
could alert the physician in case of medication errors, for example, when a medication is
ordered to which the patient is allergic. The order must quickly and correctly be transmitted
to the service unit. If a specimen is transferred, it must be guaranteed that the order and the
specimen can be linked to each other at the service unit. If necessary, modification to already
transferred orders by the ordering health care professional should be possible.

Appointment Scheduling

Depending on the type of order, the patient’s appointments must be scheduled (e.g., in
radiological units). During scheduling, the demands of all parties (e.g., ordering physician,
service unit, patient, transport unit) must be fairly balanced.

6.3.1.4
Execution of Diagnostic, Therapeutic and Nursing Procedures

The planned diagnostic, therapeutic, or nursing procedures (such as operations, radiother-
apy, radiological examinations, medication) must be executed (Fig. 6.9). The hospital must
offer adequate tools and resources (e.g., staff, room, equipment) for the execution of the
necessary procedures.

Itis important that changes in care planning that may be due to new findings are promptly
communicated to all involved units and persons, enabling them to adapt to the new situa-
tion. All clinically relevant patient data (such as vital signs, orders, results, decisions) must
be recorded as completely, correctly, and quickly as necessary. This supports the coordina-
tion of patient treatment among all involved persons, and also the legal justification for the
actions taken. Data should be recorded in as structured a way as possible, so as to allow for

data aggregation and statistics, computerized decision support, or retrieval of data. It is
important that data can be linked by PIN and CIN, even when data originate from different
areas (such as ward, service unit, outpatient unit). Usually, the hospital has to fulfill a lot of
different legal reporting (such as epidemiological registers) and documentation require-
ments. The items to be documented depend partly on the documenting unit and the docu-
menting health care professional group (such as documentation by health care professionals,
documentation in outpatient units or in operation rooms). Clinical information should also
be available for other functions such as financial accounting, controlling, quality manage-
ment, or research and education.
This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.10):

Execution of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures

The planned diagnostic and therapeutic procedures must be executed. All procedures must
be documented. Findings and reports must be transmitted (as quickly as necessary) back to
the ordering unit and presented to the responsible health care professional. They must be
unambiguously assigned to the correct patient. The responsible physician should be
informed about new results, and critical findings should be highlighted.

The hospital function execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be spe-
cialized, for example, to execution of operations, execution of irradiation, execution of
chemotherapy, execution of radiological examinations, execution of lab examinations, and
execution of prophylaxis and medication.
#90 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Execution of Nursing Procedures

The planned nursing procedures (concerning excretion, decubitus, hair und nail care, skin
care, wound treatment, body washing, oral and dental care, nutrition and liquid balance,
thrombosis) are executed. All patient care procedures, their impact on the patient’s health
status, and changes to the care plan have to be documented. The responsible physician
must be informed about therapy-relevant facts.

6.3.1.5
Coding of Diagnoses and Procedures

The hospital must be able to document and code all diagnoses stated and all medical proce-
dures carried out in a correct, complete, quick, and patient-oriented way. These data are the
basis for the hospital's billing. Diagnoses and medical procedures are also used for control-
ling. In addition, some of the data must be documented and communicated due to legal
requirements.

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 91

Diagnoses and medical procedures are recorded and coded in a standardized way (e.g.,
using the ICD-10' for diagnoses codes), and then processed. Diagnoses and medical pro-
cedures should be at least partly derivable from clinical documentation. To support their
documentation, adequate coding catalogs must be offered and maintained, containing lists
of typical diagnoses and medical procedures relevant for a unit or a hospital.

The enterprise function coding of diagnoses and procedures, its decomposition in sub-
functions, and the entity types to be interpreted and updated are summarized in Fig. 6.11.

6.3.1.6
Patient Discharge and Transfer to Other Institutions

When patient treatment is terminated, the patient is discharged and then sometimes
transferred to other institutions (e.g., a general practitioner (GP) or a rehabilitation center)
(Fig. 6.12). Patient discharge and transfer to other institutions (short: discharge) covers
administrative, medical, and nursing discharge.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.13):

Administrative Discharge and Billing

The process of administrative patient discharge initiates final billing and the fulfillment of
legal reporting requirements (e.g., statistics on diagnoses and procedures). During the last
years Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG ?) systems have been introduced for patient billing
in most of the industrial countries. This means that bills for patient treatment are no longer
calculated based on daily rates, but on the DRG in which a patient case was classified.
Diagnoses, procedures, patient’s age, and some more criteria serve as an input for the
calculation of a DRG.

Medical Discharge and Medical Report Writing

Medical discharge entails completing of documentation and writing of a discharge report
by the attending physician. The medical report includes relevant diagnoses, important
findings, therapeutic procedures, current patient state, and recommendations for further
treatment. The hospital must be able to transmit this and other information (e.g., radiologi-
cal images) to other institutions as quickly as possible. To speed up this process, a short
report (i.e., physician’s discharge letter) is often immediately communicated to the next
institution, containing, for example, the diagnoses and therapeutic treatments. It is then
followed by a more detailed report.

*http://www.fas.org/ota/reports/8306.pdf
#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 93

Nursing Discharge and Nursing Report Writing

Nursing discharge entails completing of documentation and writing of a nursing report by
the attending nurse. The nursing report comprises, for example, information about activity
level, diet, and wound care.

6.3.2
Supply and Disposal Management, Scheduling, and Resource Allocation

The hospital must offer sufficient and well-organized resources for patient care. This is
true for wards (ward management), outpatient units (outpatient management), and service
units (department management). Efficient process organization is extremely important for
hospitals, for example, in outpatient units or service units, and it can be supported, for
example, by providing working lists for individual staff members, by issuing reminders
about appointments, or by visualizing actual process flow. The HIS must be able to support
communication between all persons involved in patient care. This comprises synchronous
(e.g., telephone) and asynchronous (e.g., blackboards, brochures, e-mail) communication.
Staff members must be able to be contacted within a prescribed period of time.

6.3.2.1

Supply and Disposal Management

Supply and disposal of materials, food, drugs, and so on must be guaranteed. All depart-

ments of the hospital should be able to order from up-to-date catalogs. The corresponding

service units (stock, pharmacy, and kitchen) must be able to deliver correctly and on time.
Supply and disposal management can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.14):

Catering

According to their health status, patients have different nutritional needs. It must be ensured

that the patients are provided with the right dietary food at the right time.

Material and Medication Management

Nurses and doctors must be able to anticipate lack of material like medical strips, ban-
dages, or needles to order new material from a central supplier in time (see Fig. 6.15).

Laundry Management

The hospital must permanently be supplied with linen, towels, sterile scrubs, surgical
masks, etc.

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 95

Management of Medical Devices

In addition to other resources, medical devices must be registered and maintained accord-
ing to legislation. Due maintenance must be organized, documented, and completed.

6.3.2.2
Scheduling and Resource Allocation

Various resources are needed for patient care, and resource management comprises staff
planning, bed planning, room planning, and device planning. All resource-planning activi-
ties must be coordinated. When procedures are scheduled, the demands of both the service
unit and the ordering unit with regard to scheduling the appointment must be considered.
Request, reservation, confirmation, notification, postponement, and cancellation must be
supported. All involved staff members and patients should be informed about the appoint-
ments. Postponements and cancellations should be communicated in time to all persons
involved.

This hospital function can be decomposed into appointment scheduling, scheduling and
resource planning with the medical service unit, and scheduling and resource planning
with the patient transport service (see Fig. 6.10). Appointment scheduling was also listed
as a subfunction of patient admission.

6.3.2.3
Human Resources Management

This contains all tasks for the development and improvement of the productivity of staff.
It comprises, for example, staff and position planning, staff register, staff scheduling, and
staff payroll.

Hospital Administration

Hospital administration supports the organization of patient care and guarantees the finan-
cial survival and the economic success of the hospital. Its subfunctions are:
#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 97

6.3.3.1
Patient Administration

Patient administration comprises the administrative tasks in a hospital dealing more or
less immediately with patients. Thus it is an aggregation of the subfunctions of administra-
tive admission, patient identification and checking for recurrent, visitor and information
service (see Sect. 6.3.1.1), and administrative discharge and billing (see Sect. 6.3.1.6).

6.3.3.2
Archiving of Patient Information

Relevant data and documents containing patient information must be created, gathered,
presented, and stored such that they are efficiently retrievable during the whole process of
patient treatment. The storage of these data and documents is primarily done in patient
records. Today, usually a mixture of paper-based and computer-based patient records is
used. Certain legal requirements usually must be considered.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.18):

#98 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Opening of a Patient Record

Administrative admission triggers the opening of a patient record. The patient record may
be electronic or paper-based or a mixture of both. For the filing formats of documents
standards have to be established and used.

Administration and Allocation of Patient Records

A paper-based hospital archive must be able to manage patient records and make them
available upon request within a defined time frame. The exact location of each record
should be known (e.g., in which archive, on which shelf). Robot systems may store and
gather paper-based records automatically (see Fig. 6.19). Lending and return of records
(e.g., for patients coming for multiple visits) have to be organized, while respecting differ-
ent access rights that depend on the role of the health care professionals in the process of
patient care.

Fig. 6.19 A paper-based hospital archive with a robot system for storing and gathering boxes filled
with patient records
#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 99

Long-Term Archiving

After the discharge of the patient, patient records must be archived for a long time (e.g.,
for 10 or 30 years, depending on the legal regulations). The archive must offer enough
space to allow the long-term storage of patient records (see Sect. 6.7.4.1). Their authentic-
ity and correctness can be proven more easily, for example, in case of legal action, when
they are archived in accordance with legal regulations.

6.3.3.3
Quality Management

Quality management comprises all activities of a health care institution’s management to
assure and continuously improve the quality of patient care. This includes setting goals,
defining responsibilities, and establishing and monitoring the processes to achieve these
goals. This covers, for example, internal reporting containing quality indices. Quality
management requires information about patients and treatments as well as knowledge
about diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.20):

Internal Quality Management

Internal quality management assures a defined quality of all processes and outcomes of the
hospital. An internal reporting system, which presents quality-related indicators, is also
covered. Medical, nursing, and administrative guidelines may be defined, stored, and pre-
sented. There exists a structured complaint management.

Performance of Legal Notification Requirements

Legal notification requirements for quality assurance must be completed.

6.3.3.4
Cost Accounting

For controlling purposes, it is necessary to keep track of services, their costs, and who has
received them. Cost accounting usually investigates which costs incur (cost-type account-
ing), where costs incur (cost center accounting), and for what activities or services costs
incur (cost unit accounting). According to the accounting purpose, the time period to be
observed and the scope of the costs to be accounted have to be defined. The results of cost
accounting, that is, KPIs, serve as input for controlling (see Figs. 6.21 and 6.22).

6.3.3.5
Controlling

The hospital must be able to gather and aggregate data about the hospital's operation in order
to control and optimize it. This covers, for example, staff controlling, process controlling, mate-
rial controlling, and financial controlling. In hospitals, for example, the number of patient cases,
the length of patient stays in the hospital, and the case mix index, which is calculated from the
patients” DRGs, are KPIs serving as input for controlling reports (see Figs. 6.22 and 6.23).

Financial Accounting

All the hospital’s financial operations have to be systematically recorded to meet legal
requirements. Financial accounting comprises, for example, debtor accounting, credit
accounting, and asset accounting. It needs information from bills and creates new values
for KPIs (see Fig. 6.24). The hospital must support general statistical analysis, for exam-
ple, calculation and analysis of economic data.

6.3.3.7
Facility Management

Facility management comprises the management of buildings, areas, and utilities of the
hospital and also influences KPIs (see Fig. 6.25).

6.33.8
Information Management?

Information management plans the information system of an enterprise and its architecture,
directs its establishment and its operation, and monitors its development and operation
with respect to the planned objectives. Different management levels have different percep-
tions and interests.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.26):

Strategic Information Management

Strategic information management deals with the enterprise’s information processing as a
whole and establishes strategies and principles for the evolution of the information system.

*Now we've come full circle. Our book deals with information management and especially strate-
gic information management. Since information systems are subject of information management
and information systems shall support all necessary functions of an enterprise, they shall support
information management as well. For a more thorough explanation of strategic information man-
agement refer to Chap. 9.

#104 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

An important result of strategic management activities is a strategic information manage-
ment plan, which is aligned with the hospital’s business strategy. It includes the direction and
strategy of information management and the architecture of the enterprise information
system.

Tactical Information Management

Tactical information management deals with particular enterprise functions or application
components that are introduced, removed, or changed. Usually these activities are done in
the form of projects. Such tactical information management projects are initiated by stra-
tegic information management. Thus, strategic information management is a vital neces-
sity for tactical information management. The result of tactical information management
projects is the information system.

Operational Information Management

Operational information management is responsible for operating the components of the
information system. It cares for its smooth operation in accordance with the strategic infor-
mation management plan. Additionally, operational information management plans,
directs, and monitors permanent services for the users of the information system.

6.3.4
Hospital Management

Hospital management decides on questions of fundamental importance for the hospital
development (hospital goals, strategic decisions, personnel decisions and decisions about
budget, investments, and key treatments). Hospital management has to focus on high qual-
ity of patient care taking into account economic as well as legal and other requirements.
Information needed and produced is shown in Fig. 6.27.

6.3.5
Research and Education

Especially in academic centers efficient research and education must be supported. The
objective of clinical research is the generalization of findings and experiences to gain new
knowledge. Data documented during the patient treatment process may be used for retro-
spective analysis, to find hints for generalization and generate hypotheses for new
studies.

This hospital function can be decomposed as follows (see Fig. 6.28):

6.3.5.1
Research Management

Research management is executed in all organizational units of the hospital which decide
upon planning, monitoring, and directing research activities. This includes the documenta-
tion of research activities as well as the management of third-party funds.

6.3.5.2
Execution of Clinical Trials and Experiments

Experiments and clinical trials are important for the progress in medicine because they
update medical and nursing knowledge. Scientific staff must be supported in planning,
executing, and analyzing studies and experiments. Planning and execution must conform
to legal requirements; for example, patients have to be informed about chances and risks
before they can consent to take part in a clinical trial.

6.3.5.3
Knowledge Retrieval and Literature Management

Scientific staff needs access to research-relevant information and general medical
knowledge. In addition, doctors and nurses must be provided with specific medical
knowledge.

6.3.5.4
Publishing and Presentation

Scientific staff needs to prepare publications and presentations. Therefore, central collec-
tions of both the hospital’s relevant publications and other literature need to be made avail-
able to them and can be arranged according to year, institution, topic, or person.

6.3.5.5
Education

Medical casuistics have to be made available for training and education in medical profes-
sions. Furthermore, the organization and execution of teaching and exams, for example, by
e-learning tools, have to be supported.

6.3.6
Clinical Documentation: A Hospital Function?

It may be surprising that ‘documentation’ is not listed as a hospital function in the previous
sections. In fact, clinical documentation, which comprises medical documentation and
nursing documentation, is a time-consuming and often unpopular duty of health profes-
sionals in a hospital. Moreover, every hospital function described so far requires a lot of

#6.3 Domain Layer: Hospital Functions 107

documentation. During patient admission, identifying data and general health data about
the patient have to be documented, the results of diagnostic procedures have to be written
down, discharge summaries have to be documented, and so on. Hence, how does “docu-
mentation” fit into our 3LGM?-based view on HIS architectures? As the aforementioned
examples show, documentation takes place every time a function is executed, new infor-
mation is generated, and respective data are stored somehow somewhere.

In Sect. 5.3.2.4 we already described this in a more formal way:

Defining documentation needs at least one function, one entity type, and one applica-
tion component, which are interrelated as follows: if an entity type E is updated by an
enterprise function and this entity type’s data are stored in an application component, we
call this combination the documentation of entity type E.

Thus, every introduced function which updates an entity type is a documenting
function.

6.3.7

6.3.7.1
Differences in Hospital Functions

Look at the hospital functions presented in this section. Now imagine a small hospital (e.g.,
350 beds) and a big university medical center (e.g., 1,500 beds). What are the differences
between these hospitals with regard to their enterprise functions? Explain your answer.

6.3.7.2
Different Health Care Professional Groups and Hospital Functions

Look at the hospital functions listed in this section. Analyze the relationships between the
hospital functions and the different health care professional groups (physicians, nurses,
administrative staff, others) working in a hospital. Which hospital functions are performed
by which health care professional group?

Create a table with health care professional groups as columns, hospital functions as
rows, and the following symbols as content in the boxes:

“++”: Enterprise function is primarily performed by this profession.
“+”: Enterprise function is also performed by this profession.

“=: Enterprise function is not performed by this profession.

«>: Neither “++, “+,” nor “—".

6.3.7.3
Support of Hospital Functions

As discussed at the beginning of this section, we have presented the main hospital func-
tions that should be supported by a HIS. Look at a hospital you know and try to find out for
each hospital function whether more computer-based or more paper-based information-
processing tools are used to support it.
#108 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

6.3.7.4
The Patient Entity Type

Take a look at the entity type patient interpreted and updated by various enterprise func-
tions. Which enterprise functions update the patient information and which interpret it?

6.3.8
Demain Layer: Summary

The main patient care functions are:

patient admission with appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for
recurrent, administrative admission, medical admission, nursing admission, visitor and
information service,

decision making, planning, and organization of patient treatment with decision making
and patient information, as well as medical and nursing care planning,

order entry with preparation of an order, appointment scheduling,

execution of diagnostic, therapeutic, and nursing procedures;

coding of diagnoses and procedures;

patient discharge and transfer to other institutions with administrative discharge and
billing, medical discharge and medical report writing, nursing discharge and nursing
report writing.

These patient care functions are typically complemented by enterprise functions such as:

supply and disposal management, scheduling and resource allocation, human resources
management,

hospital administration with patient administration, archiving of patient information,
quality management, cost accounting, controlling, financial accounting, facility man-
agement, information management,

hospital management,

research and education.

These hospital functions describe what a HIS should support. It is not important at this
point how they are supported — by non-computer-based or by computer-based information-
processing tools.

All hospital functions introduced earlier are summarized on a 3LGM? domain layer in

Fig. 6.29.
The hospital functions update and interpret different entity types. The following entity
types are related to patient history:

case, clinical pathway, clinical trial, diagnosis, diagnosis class, discharge summary,
external finding, finding, informed consent, medical anamnesis, medical procedure,
nursing anamnesis, nursing procedure, order, procedure, patient, patient transport,
procedure class, sample, transfer.

#110 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

The following entity types represent resources:
e appointment, bed, health care professional, drug, food, human resource, laundry, mate-
rial, means of transport, medical and nursing knowledge, medical device, room, service.

The following entity types are related to administration:

e patient record archive, classification, classification of diagnoses, classification of pro-
cedures, cost unit, bill, budget, information system model, facility and area, notifica-
tion, service catalog, third-party fund.

The following entity types are important for management:
® business strategy, controlling report, strategic information management plan,
health care regulation, KPI, project, quality report.Logical Tool Layer: Application Components

After having looked at hospital functions in the previous section we now describe informa-
tion-processing tools at the logical tool layer of HIS, that is, the application components
supporting these functions.

Taking the enterprise functions into account, we will sum up the task of the application
components by tables enumerating the supported hospital functions; you may refer to
Sect. 6.3 for their detailed descriptions. In addition, for every function we list typical fea-
tures the application component should offer. A feature is a functionality offered by a
software product which directly contributes to the fulfillment of one or more enterprise
functions (compare Sect. 5.3.4). We denote features by a short phrase consisting of at least
one verb and one noun expressing an ability of the software product, for example, “gener-
ate a unique PIN”, “provide catalog of diagnoses”. Features need not be directly invoked
by a person, but can be triggered when using a preceding feature of the software product.
The finer the granularity of an enterprise function is formulated, the greater is the probabil-
ity that the enterprise function semantically corresponds with a feature an application com-
ponent offers.

Each health institution uses a different set of computer-based and non-computer-based
application components (organizational systems) to support its enterprise functions.
However, in hospitals typical basic application components supporting specific hospital
functions can be identified. In this section, we take a closer look at basic application com-
ponents used in HIS. In the following section we will then discuss how these basic compo-
nents can be combined similar to developing a city by stepwise adding new or replacing
old buildings.

In spite of the still existing significance of non-computer-based information processing
in hospitals we will focus here on computer-based application components. But we will
discuss non-computer-based application components as well in Sect. 6.4.16.
#6.4 Logical Tool Layer: Application Components m

Note that we refer to some of the components as “XYZ information system” (e.g.,
“Laboratory Information System”). Although this sounds contradictory to our definition of
the term “information system” we use the terminology in order to integrate popular
names.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following question:
e What application components are used in hospitals, and what are their characteristics?

6.4.1
Patient Administration System

The patient administration system supports the administration of patients and their con-
tacts at the hospital. Especially for patient admission, discharge, and billing of patients this
application component will be used. It must provide correct, complete, and up-to-date
administrative patient data for all other application components. In addition, all other
application components must be able to transmit relevant administrative patient data (e.g.,
diagnoses) to the patient administration system. Therefore, the patient administration sys-
tem can be regarded as the center of the administrative memory of the HIS.

During patient admission, patient administration systems must support patient retrieval
(e.g., by name or birth date) to avoid duplicate and erroneous registration of patients. The
resulting identification numbers PIN and CIN are of utmost importance for the whole
information system. They are the basis for correct assignment of patient-related data to

patients and thus are the very precondition for a valid patient record — regardless of whether
itis electronic or not. Without the correct PIN and CIN all the high technology of a modern

HIS would be useless.
#6.4 Logical Tool Layer: Application Components 113

Application components providing a correct PIN are often called a master patient index
(MPI). Hence a patient administration system shall contain an MPI. It is essential to have
only one MPI in a health information system — regardless of whether it is a HIS or a
transinstitutional health information system.

Both PIN and CIN, as well as the related patient information, must be made available
to other application components of the hospital. If the patient already has a paper-based
patient record, the application component should automatically trigger the transfer of this
record from the patient record archive to the unit where the patient has been admitted.

In addition, the patient administration system may update patient information in case of
changes, or merge patient information from two cases if a new PIN was wrongly assigned
to a patient.

The patient administration system (Fig. 6.30) is usually not only used by administrative
staff but also by nurses and doctors at the ward. In the latter case it also supports daily
management activities by health care professionals that occur on a ward. It especially sup-
ports the assignment of patients to beds and rooms with the features shown in Table 6.1.

6.4.2
Medical Documentation System

The medical documentation system (see Fig. 6.31) supports specific documentation tasks
(e.g., patient history, planning of care, progress notes, report writing). Typically, it con-
tains specialized modules for different medical fields (e.g., ophthalmology, psychiatry,

dermatology). They normally offer generic forms for free-text, semi-structured, or struc-
tured (e.g., drop-down lists) data entry for medical documentation, as well as support for
speech recognition, reporting, and analysis features. The more data are structured, the
easier are patient-related computer-based decision support and statistical data analysis. It
is important that users are able to adapt the features to their needs (e.g., by defining which
items have to be documented, and which constraints the entered data must meet). When
reports are generated, the reuse of already-documented data (e.g., diagnoses, findings
from radiology or lab) should be supported.

Besides clinical documentation, the coding of diagnoses and procedures is very impor-
tant. Coding components must support the easy search for suitable diagnosis and proce-
dure classes and their respective codes in classifications for a given medical field.
Alternatively, free text can be analyzed using natural language recognition methods. If
these coding components are separate from the documentation components, it must be
guaranteed that the codes can be transferred to medical documentation components. The
medical documentation system should also allow an adequate layout of diverse reports.
‘When several persons are involved in the creation of a report (e.g., discharge letters may
#6.4 Logical Tool Layer: Application Components 115

be dictated by a junior physician, written by a secretary, and approved by a senior physi-
cian), the application components should support the management and distribution of dif-
ferent versions of a document having different status (like preliminary or approved).

Medical documentation is the basis for decision making and planning of patient treat-
ment. Hence the medical documentation system has to support medical staff by providing
medical knowledge, which should be preselected using documented data about the patient’s
conditions; ideally a respective “infobutton” should be implemented.

Table 6.2 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

64.3
Nursing Management and Documentation System

The nursing management and documentation system (see Fig. 6.32) offers similar features
as the medical documentation system. Nursing is usually oriented toward the so-called nurs-

ing process, which mainly comprises nursing patient history, nursing care planning with
definition of problems, formulation of nursing aims, and planning of nursing tasks, fol-
lowed by execution of nursing tasks and evaluation of results. The nursing management
and documentation system has to support the documentation of all of those steps. To sup-
port nursing care planning, the definition and use of predefined nursing care plans (compris-
ing recent problems of the patient, nursing goals, and planned nursing tasks) are helpful.

Table 6.3 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.4
Outpatient Management System

Outpatient care means patient care during one or several short visits in outpatient depart-
ments (clinics) in a hospital. In most cases, those visits are related to previous or future
inpatient stays in the same hospital.

Fig. 6.33 Screenshot of an application component for scheduling in an outpatient unit

The outpatient management system is comparable to the medical documentation sys-
tem. Differences exist with regard to a stronger support of appointment scheduling
(Fig. 6.33) and waiting list management, and stronger work organization support (e.g.,
task lists, printing of receipts). Additionally many countries have different regulations
for in- and outpatient billing. Thus particular features are needed for billing in outpa-
tient departments. These special requirements usually lead to specialized outpatient
management systems instead of using the medical documentation system in outpatient
settings.

Upon patient discharge, a short report is written and communicated to the institution
that continues treating the patient (e.g., the GP or a ward).

Table 6.4 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

The functions are similar to functions needed in GPs’ offices. Therefore, software prod-
ucts used in GPs’ offices are sometimes also implemented in outpatient units in hospitals.
These products are attractive, as they offer specific documentation modules for different
medical areas (e.g., graphical tools for the documentation of dermatological status for
dermatologists). In addition, the software products for billing can also often be transferred
easily and cheaply.

However, outpatient management systems must be closely connected to other applica-
tion components used on the ward or in other units in order to support the close coopera-
tion of inpatient and outpatient care. This is often difficult when software products from
GPs’ offices are used. Therefore, software products from vendors with experience in the
area of HIS may be better from an integration point of view. However, in this case, the
range of supported functions may not be as broad as if software products from vendors
who specialize in the GPs’ area are used.

Provider or Physician Order Entry System (POE)

A provider or physician order entry system (POF) (computer-supported POE systems are
called CPOE) supports order entry. This can comprise both order entry of diagnostic or
therapeutic procedures and ordering of drugs. POE systems support formulation of the
order, appointment scheduling, printing of labels, and the communication of the order to
the service unit (Fig. 6.34). In case of ordering drugs, physicians may choose the most
appropriate drug or generic drug from drug catalogs. The POE system may then also offer
decision-support functionality such as dosage calculation, drug—drug interaction checks,
drug allergy checks or drug lab checks to prevent prescription errors. In case of ordering
diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, the results (e.g., lab values or an x-ray report) have
then to be communicated back to the ordering facility. POE systems offer service catalogs
that present the available service types of the different service units (e.g., laboratory,

radiology, surgery). Order sets that describe a typical set of combined orders (e.g., a com-
bination of diagnostic procedures that have to be performed in a given situation) can sup-
port the ordering process; they are activated and modified by the ordering clinician. Some
POE systems support receiving and presenting findings. However, this is usually done by
other application components like the radiology information system (RIS) or laboratory
information system (LIS) .

Table 6.5 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually

#120 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

6.4.6
Patient Data Management System (PDMS)

Seriously ill patients are treated in intensive care units. These patients are generally in an
unstable state, and within seconds may enter into a life-endangering situation. Thus, the
detailed and complete presentation of all vital parameters (e.g., blood pressure, pulse,
breathing frequency) is required for a successful therapy. This is only possible when auto-
mated monitoring devices continuously measure and record various parameters. In addi-
tion, parameters that can point to the initial deterioration of the patient’s status should be
automatically detected and should lead to an immediate alert of the treating health care
professionals.

The patient data management system (PDMS) is specialized to automatically monitor,
store, and clearly present a vast amount of patient-related clinical data in intensive care
units (see Fig. 6.35). It also supports scoring (e.g., TISS,® SAPS’) and may offer features
for decision support and various statistical analyses.

#122 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

After transfer to a regular ward, a short summary of the therapy on the intensive care
unit should be created and communicated to the application components on the ward. In
addition, a connection to the application components for order entry and result reporting is
necessary. Software for a PDMS is sold both by specialized vendors and by vendors that
also offer automated monitoring tools.

Table 6.6 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.7
Operation Management System

In ORs, invasive procedures are performed. Usually, patients stay in the OR for only a few
hours. During this time, they are prepared for the operation, the operation is performed,
and finally, for a period of time after the operation, the patients’ state is monitored.

The operation management system supports operation planning and operation docu-
mentation as a specialization of execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. It
allows assigning of operation date and time, and therefore should be available on the wards
as well as in the offices and management units of the ORs. Depending on the planned
operations, an operation plan can be created for a day or a week (Fig. 6.36). The data nec-
essary for efficient planning are the diagnoses of the patient, the planned operation (medi-
cal procedure), the surgeons and other staff (human resources) involved, the planned time

for operation (appointment), and the available ORs (space). Therefore, the operation man-
agement system should be closely connected to the medical documentation system.

During each operation, a large number of data have to be documented, including the
members of the operating team, operative procedure, date and time, duration of the opera-
tion, materials (e.g., implants) used, and other necessary data to describe the operation and
its results. Surgeons cooperate closely with anesthesiologists during the operation. For
their documentation anesthesiologists need a number of data, which have usually to be
documented by surgeons and vice versa. To avoid transcriptions, an operation manage-
ment system should therefore also provide supportive features for anesthesiologists in an
integrated way.

#124 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Usually, the planning data are taken from the operation planning component to be
updated and completed during and after the operation. Based on these data, an operation
report can be created, which may be completed with further comments of the surgeons.
Therefore, word-processing capability is needed. Operation data needed for billing must
be coded and then communicated to the administrative application components. The oper-
ation management system should also allow extensive data analysis (e.g., operation lists
for junior surgeons). It should replace the often-used operation book, where all operations
are documented by hand.

Table 6.7 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.8
Radiology Information System

In radiology departments, in- and outpatients are examined. When radiological examina-
tions are needed, the ward or outpatient unit orders them and schedules an appointment.
The examination itself may then be done using an analog technology (e.g., x-ray and films)
or digital technology (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultra-
sonography, digital radiography). The tools that generate images are called modalities.

Based on the generated images, a specialist in radiology creates a report, which is then sent
and presented (sometimes together with selected pictures) to the ordering physician.
Application components for radiological units therefore comprise features for departmen-
tal management, including report writing, image storing, and communication. In this sec-
tion we will focus on departmental management; Sect. 6.4.9 will deal with image storing
and communication.

The radiology information system (RIS) offers features comparable to those of the out-
patient management systems (see Sect. 6.4.4), that is, features for registering patients,
appointment scheduling, organization of examinations and staff (workflow management),
provision of patient data and examination parameters, creation of radiology reports, docu-
mentation and coding of activities, and statistics. A special feature is the close connection
to the modalities: The RIS typically provides a working list (i.e., patient name and requested
examination) for the modalities, and gets back a confirmation on the completion of a radio-
logic examination from the modalities. Due to these special features, software for RIS typi-
cally comes from specialized vendors (Fig. 6.37).

Table 6.8 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.9
Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)

In case of analog pictures, so-called archive management systems support their archiving
(often stored in dedicated picture archives), and their retrieving and lending.

By contrast, digital images are stored in the Picture Archiving and Communication
System (PACS). This application component allows the storage, management, manipula-
tion, and presentation of large numbers of image data (Fig. 6.38) and their quick commu-
nication from the storage media to the attached workstations for the diagnosing specialists
or for the ordering departments. Quick communication may require a prefetching strategy
to retrieve image data from slower storage devices and to provide it at faster devices well
in advance to the situation they will be needed in.

Software products for PACS also comprise means for image processing and are often
offered by vendors, which also offer physical data processing systems such as storage,
networks, and modalities.

Obviously RIS and PACS should be closely connected. They should also have a close
connection to the patient administration system, medical documentation system, POE,
#6.4 Logical Tool Layer: Application Components 127

and the PDMS, in order to allow quick access to reports and imaging pictures from
every unit.

Table 6.9 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.10
Laboratory Information System

During execution of lab examinations, specimens of patients (e.g., blood sample, tissue
sample) are used. Appointments are therefore not necessary. Depending on the type of
laboratory, different examination technologies are used (e.g., chemical analysis of blood
samples, microscopical analysis, and tissue samples). Chemical analysis is usually done by
automated equipment. Depending on the order, the sample is usually automatically distrib-
uted to various analytical devices, which are regularly checked for their precision in order
to conform to quality management requirements. In addition, the laboratory physician
checks all results of a sample for plausibility (so-called validation).

The laboratory information system (LIS) supports the management of the whole pro-
cedure of analysis: the receipt of the order and the sample, the distribution of the sample
and the order to the different analytical devices, the collection of the results, the technical
and clinical validation of results, the communication of the findings back to the ordering
department, as well as general quality management procedures (Fig. 6.39). The validation
of laboratory results is more effective when patient-related clinical data (e.g., recent

diagnoses, drug medication) are accessible to the laboratory physician. The LIS, therefore,
should be closely connected to the medical documentation system, outpatient manage-
ment system, POE, and PDMS. Software for LIS is usually also sold by specialized
vendors.

Table 6.10 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.11
Enterprise Resource Planning System

The enterprise resource planning system (often: ERP system) enables a hospital to manage
its financial, human, and material resources. It thus supports hospital functions such as
controlling, financial accounting, facility management, human resources management,
quality management, and supply and disposal management.

A close connection is needed especially to the patient administration system but also to
the other application components mentioned earlier, in order to obtain, for example, billing
data and legally required diagnoses and procedure codes. Most of the software products
used for ERP systems in hospitals are not specific to hospitals, but are also used in other
industries outside health care where similar administrative functions have to be supported.

One major goal of the ERP system is the documentation and billing of all accountable
services. The types of data needed and the details of billing depend on the country’s health
care system.

Table 6.11 presents important hospital functions and related tasks with regard to the
ERP system. The presented table is not exhaustive and just describes a selection of items.

A data warehouse system contains data which have been extracted from other application
components. The data have been transferred and aggregated into a suitable format and then
actively loaded into the data warehouse (push-principle). A specific request on the data
will only access data already loaded into the data warehouse.
#130 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

There are two major fields of application for data warehouse systems in hospitals. They
can either be used for hospital management or for research.

For decision-making the management of a hospital needs up-to-date information about
the hospitals operating as a whole (Fig. 6.40). The management of a hospital is, for exam-
ple, interested in answers to questions like these: What are the top ten diagnoses of the
patients treated in our hospital? Which department of the hospital causes the highest mate-
rial costs? In which department do patients stay longest on average?

A data warehouse system can help to answer these questions by pooling manage-
ment-relevant data from other systems such as the ERP system and the CPOE system
and by providing means for analyzing these data by data mining techniques. A data
warehouse system supporting hospital management is often called business intelligence
system.

In contrast to other enterprises, the data warehouse systems in hospitals are not only
important for management-related and, thus, primarily cost-related issues, but also for
medical issues, especially for clinical trials. If data from the medical documentation
system have been loaded into a data warehouse system, the recruitment of patients for
clinical trials as well as the statistical evaluation of patient data can be effectively
supported.

cal data warehouse (CDW)” which provides implementation guidance for data warehouses
in a HIS.

Table 6.12 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.13
Document Archiving System

As increasing patient-related data are available in a digital form, the question of long-term
archiving has to be solved. Depending upon the type of data and national laws, patient-
related data have to be stored up to 30 years. For long-term archiving, confidentiality,
availability, and integrity of the data according to the OAIS38 (ISO 14721) model must be
guaranteed. Availability means that data must be retrievable and readable at any time
throughout the archiving period. To ensure integrity, data must be complete and unchanged.
In health care, authenticity of the author and the time of the creation of a document are
important aspects of integrity. For example, unauthorized alteration of the date of creation
results in the loss of integrity of archived data. The conditions of confidentiality, availabil-
ity, and integrity can hardly be met by individual clinical application components that may
not be available in 30 years.

The document archiving system offers long-term archiving of patient-related and other
data and documents based on sustainable standardized data formats, document formats,
and interfaces. The system also provides standardized indexing of document content and
regular updates of storage media. Qualified electronic signatures, for example, in compli-
ance with the European guideline 1999/93/EG, can be used to guarantee long-term integ-
rity of stored data in case the document archiving system is enabled to renew outdated
signatures and hash algorithms. The document archiving system is typically closely linked
to all application components that generate data and documents which it has to store for a
long time. It gets copies of data and documents from those components, indexes them, and

the laboratory, operation reports, letters, anamneses, etc., it also contains radiological images

stores them, while enabling fast retrieval. Paper-based documents can be integrated by

scanning, which allows for eliminating the physical place needed for paper-based archiving.

Typically, document archiving systems can archive not only text-related documents, but

also images, videos, and other multimedia data (see screenshot in Fig. 6.41). All these

documents may be stored using established non-proprietary industry standards such as:

® ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange),

eo PDEF/A, which is an ISO standard for long-time archiving of documents based on the
Portable Document Format (PDF),

eo XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

e TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)

e JPEG and MPEG, which are acronyms for the names of the committees who created the
standards (Joint Photographic Experts Group and Moving Pictures Expert Group)

eo DICOM (see Sect. 6.5.4.3)

In addition, there exists the document format CDA’, which can be used for structuring
clinical documents. Currently, CDA is mainly used for electronic discharge letters and
reports. However, it has the potential to become an important standard for document
archives because CDA documents include metadata that facilitate the reuse of documents,
for example, for decision support systems. Archived XML data (such as CDA) should
include the corresponding Document Type Definitions (DTD) in the form of XSD (XML

In health care, image data ought to be archived using lossless compression.

Patient-related medical data and documents stored in the document archiving system
have to be made available to the medical documentation system in order to enable their
users to directly access information from earlier patient contacts.

Table 6.13 sums up the hospital functions being supported and the features usually
offered for these functions.

6.4.14
Other Computer-Based Application Components

In addition to the computer-based application components introduced so far, we can usu-
ally find many other, often department-specific application components in a hospital. For
example, depending on the size of the hospital, a hospital can have its own pharmacy
department, which needs a pharmacy information system to supply wards and finally
patients with the right drugs in the right dose. Depending on the specializations of a hospi-
tal there can be, for example, a cardiovascular information system (CVIS) or a dialysis
information system, which are specialized medical documentation systems. Furthermore,
there are some application components that are not necessarily department-specific or
medicine-related, but support a smooth workflow in different departments of the hospital.
An example is a digital dictation system which assists doctors in writing discharge letters
or reports on diagnostic findings.

Table 6.14 lists some of these specific application components but it is not intended to
be exhaustive.

Until now we focused on “classical” application components, that is, software installa-
tions in a HIS primarily supporting the hospital functions as listed in Sect. 6.3. But there
are increasing installations of software in hospitals which are primarily controlling medi-
cal devices. Hence, medical devices can increasingly be considered to be application

components and in many cases to be specialized medical documentation systems.
Consequently, they not only provide information (e.g., findings and images) via respective
interfaces, but need information from other application components (e.g., patient, case,
order) as well. This close interconnection is often referred to by the term “converging
technologies” (compare example 9.8.4). Due to the considerable risks for patients’ safety
reasonable care has to be exercised when integrating these converging technologies into
the computer-supported part of a HIS.

6.4.15
Clinical Information System and Electronic Patient Record System
as Comprehensive Application Components

Not every HIS contains a medical documentation system, an outpatient management sys-
tem, a nursing management and documentation system, or a CPOE system as separate,
identifiable application components. Instead, these components are often closely integrated
#6.4 Logical Tool Layer: Application Components 135

modules of a so-called clinical information system (CIS). A CIS supports the hospital func-
tions as enumerated in Table 6.2 to Table 6.5.

CISs are also often called electronic patient record systems (EPR systems). As intro-
duced in Sect. 4.4, the electronic patient record (EPR), that is, the electronic health record
(EHR) in a hospital, is a complete or partial patient record stored on an electronic storage
medium. Given this definition, every computer-based application component supporting
the execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures or other subfunctions of patient
care (e.g., medical documentation system, outpatient management system, nursing man-
agement and documentation system, PDMS) contains at least a partial EPR. In a CIS, these
partial EPRs are often integrated and made available to the professionals from all areas of
a hospital to provide one harmonized view on the data of a patient. Because of this harmo-
nized view the term EPR system as a particular application component has become quite
common.

6.4.16
Typical Non-Computer-Based Application Components

Non-computer-based application components contain rules and plans regarding how and
in which context what non-computer-based physical tools shall be used in order to support
particular enterprise functions.

The coverage of hospital functions by computer-based application components is ris-
ing, but most hospitals still have non-computer-based application components and use
paper as a physical tool. For example, in a typical medium-sized hospital, parts of clinical
documentation while performing hospital functions are still done with paper-based patient
records. Thus, despite the growing portion of electronic documents, the “paperless hospi-
tal” still seems to be a remote ideal today. There might be a continuing need for some
paper-based documents. Typical application components that are still paper-based in a
larger percentage of hospitals comprise, for example, the patient chart, the patient record,
and clinical textbooks and knowledge sources.

6.4.16.1
The Paper-Based Patient Chart System

The patient chart system supports documentation and presentation of body temperature,
blood pressure, pulse, and other vital signs (see Fig. 6.42). It typically also contains physi-
cian orders to other health care professionals such as drug orders, orders of examinations,
or orders for special dietary. In addition, it may describe executed procedures (e.g., drug is
given, examination is ordered) as well as findings (e.g., relevant lab values) and a lot of
other clinical information. The patient chart is typically a central interprofessional com-
munication tool that supports quite a lot of enterprise functions and processes that all need
to be computer-based before it can be completely replaced. We can denote the application
component that builds on the patient chart as patient chart system, indicating that it is
made up of the patient chart and the organizational rules that define who may use which
part of the chart in which situation.

#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 137

6.4.16.2
The Paper-Based Patient Record System

The paper-based patient record system, comprising a paper file and the organizational rules
regarding which papers have to be collected where by whom, serves as a collection of all
documents that are either available only in paper-based form (such as the patient chart) or
that are printed out by computer-based application components to support easier access to
relevant data (such as print-out of new findings) (see Fig. 6.43). As long as not all docu-
ments are generated and used only in a computer-based form, the paper-based patient
record system will remain an important collection for paper-based patient information (by
this complementing the EPR, see Sects. 4.4 and 6.4.15).Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components

As has been seen, a HIS typically comprises various application components that need to
be integrated to achieve high quality of information processing. Integration in general
describes a union of parts making a whole, which — as opposed to its parts — displays a new
quality. For example, an integrated computer-supported HIS offers better support for
enterprise functions and business processes than isolated components, where users, for
example, may need to transfer data from one component to another manually.

But besides this meaning as a property of a system, “integration” additionally stands for
the actions to be taken in order to achieve this property and thus has a behavioral
perspective.

To achieve a high level of integration within a HIS the components need to be able to
work together, which means they need to be interoperable. Interoperability in general is the
ability of two or more components to exchange information and to use the information that
has been exchanged. A component that is called interoperable may, for example, support
certain standards for information exchange (compare Sect. 6.5.4) or certain integration
technologies (compare Sect. 6.5.5).

In this section, we discuss integration especially with respect to HIS. Please refer to Sect.
7.3.1 for the discussion of integration in transinstitutional health information systems.

HIS at different hospitals usually look different. But there are some criteria helping to
categorize the respective architectures. We will first introduce a taxonomy of architectures
of HIS, providing criteria at the logical tool layer. In Sect. 6.7.1 we will continue this tax-
onomy in order to comprise criteria at the physical tool layer as well.

Regardless of what kind of architecture has been chosen for a HIS, integrity, that is, the
correctness of data, has to be ensured. We will explain necessary conditions for integrity
of data in a HIS, which have to be met in any architecture. Integrated HIS means that all
necessary measures have been taken to ensure integrity of data by integration. But it turns
out that “integration” is a difficult term with many facets. Therefore we will then discuss
types of integration, which shall hold in any architecture. Afterwards we will introduce
standards and typical technologies used in HIS to ease integration. But despite there being
standards and technologies available to support integration in HIS, a lot of effort is still
#138 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

required. Thus it is not surprising that hospitals tend to have HIS architectures containing

very few components. We will discuss related approaches at the end of this section.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e How can architectures of HIS be categorized?

e What differentiates integrity from integration?

® What are the standards and technologies available to support the integration of HIS?

e How can integration efforts be reduced by decreasing the variety of application compo-
nents in a HIS?

6.5.1
Taxonomy of Architectures at the Logical Tool Layer

As defined in Sect. 3.3.4, the architecture of an information system describes its fundamen-
tal organization, represented by its components, their relationships to each other and to the
environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution. The components of a HIS
comprise hospital functions, business processes, and information-processing tools.

With regard to the hospital functions, there is nearly no difference between individual
HIS, as the hospitals’ goals and thus the hospitals’ functions are in general the same. All
hospital functions presented in Sect. 6.3 should thus be supported by any HIS. Remember,
from our point of view, these hospital functions can be supported by non-computer-based
or computer-based information-processing tools.

However, there are significant differences in HIS architectures with respect to the types
and relationships of information-processing tools used and the way they are integrated. We
will introduce a multidimensional taxonomy, which can be used to characterize different
styles of architectures. This taxonomy will help to describe real HIS architectures, to com-
pare them, and to assess them.

‘We first look at the logical tool layer, and later at HIS architectural styles at the physical tool
layer (see Sect. 6.7.1). Doing this, we concentrate on the computer-based part of HIS.
Architectural styles at the logical tool layer of the computer-based part of HIS are charac-
terized by:

e Number of databases being used to store (especially patient-related) data

e Number of application components used to support the hospital functions

eo Number of different software products and vendors used to install the application
components

e The patterns of communication links between the application components used

e The types of integration which could be achieved

These facets will be introduced as semantic dimensions which can be used to categorize
HIS architectures.

6.5.1.1
Number of Databases: Central Versus Distributed

Application components of a HIS may store data about certain entity types persistently
(see Sect. 5.3.2.2). Usually a database is used for this. We will use the number of databases
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 139

storing data in a HIS as the basis to distinguish possible data distribution styles at the logi-
cal tool layer of a HIS: the DB' and the DB" style.

DB’ Style

If a HIS (or its subinformation system) comprises only one database to store all patient-related
data, we call this the DB! style. This single database is often called the central database.

The precondition for the DB! style is that all computer-based application components
store their data only in the central database. This is only possible when the database schema
of the central database is known, together with the methods that are available to access and
store data there. This is usually only the case if the software products of the application
components originate from the same vendor, who designed the database, or if they are all
self-developed by a health care institution or if they have been developed particularly for
this health care institution.

If self-development of software products is considered to be too expensive, commer-
cially available software products may be used, and in most cases they will stem from
different vendors. In this case, DB! style is only possible if the central database provides
not only standardized interfaces but a standardized database schema as well. Even though
there are promising developments in the related field of service-oriented architectures
(SOAs; see Sect. 6.5.5.3), those standards are hardly implemented yet.

The DB! style therefore can be found mostly in HIS or in their subinformation systems
where application components are used that are based on homogeneous software products
(either self-developed or purchased from the same vendor; see Sect. 6.5.1.3). If application
components from different vendors are used, the so-called DB” style can usually be found.

DB" Style

In HIS that are based on commercial software components of many different vendors, we
can usually find the DB” style. This means that several application components store data
about certain entity types persistently and contain their own databases. Figure 6.44 presents
this style.

As a consequence of this style, patient-related data are stored redundantly in different appli-
cation components. For example, data about the entity types patient and case may be stored in
different application components, such as the patient administration system, LIS, and RIS.

Therefore, in this architecture, great emphasis has to be placed on the consistency of
redundant data. For example, the architecture must define which system is the responsible
source for which data elements. It may be useful to state, for example, that data about
patient and case may be created and changed only by the patient administration system
(however, the other components may locally store and use a copy of these data). We will
discuss these topics in more detail in Sect. 6.5.5.2.

In the case where different computer-based application components are not at all con-
nected, and data storage is organized completely independently, there is no way to guaran-
tee integrity and consistency of data. This application of the DB" style would have negative
consequences for data quality. It would lead to redundant data entry and erroneous data.
Thus, this HIS style usually indicates that information management has to be improved.

base system, using 3LGM, symbols. The cloud in the center indicates that some as yet unknown
means is needed to link the components

Mixed DB'/DB" Style

In practice you will hardly find HIS with pure DB! style. Even if one central application
component with the central database has been installed in order to support the hospital
functions, it is hardly possible to stop implementation of further application components
with integrated databases. Hence, even if a considerable part of these HIS is DB!-styled,
they are in fact DB"-styled. See Sect. 6.5.6.1 for a typical example.

On the other hand, even DB"-styled HIS contain subinformation systems which are
DB'-styled. We discuss these architectures in Sect. 6.5.6.1. We will refer to this mixed
style by the string “DB'/DB".”

6.5.1.2
Number of Application Components: Monolithic Versus Modular

In the simplest case, the overall HIS consists of only one computer-based application com-
ponent, which supports most of the enterprise functions. This application component looks
like the one rock on which the whole hospital rests. Respective HIS are commonly called
“monolithic.” We will refer to this style by the string “AC'.” Of course this application
component contains the central database and AC' correlates with DB'. A graphical repre-
sentation of such a (DB!, AC!) architecture is presented in Fig. 6.45.

However, one application component is usually not sufficient to support the different hos-
pital functions. Since information and communication technology increasingly intrudes in

health care, an increasing number of specialized computer-based application components as
introduced in Sect. 6.4 will be needed. This leads to architectures with a multiplicity of appli-
cation components, which can be denoted by “AC” and are called modular architectures.

However, it can also be a DB! architecture: for example, the RIS, the LIS, and the out-
patient management system share one single database management system in a certain
application component (see Fig. 6.46). This (sub-)information system could be described
by (DB', AC"). Anyhow there is a widespread use of a combination of many application
components and many databases, that is, of (DB", AC") architectures.

6.5.1.3
Number of Software Products and Vendors: All-in-One Versus Best-of-Breed

The terms “homogeneity” and “heterogeneity” are commonly used to describe whether a
HIS consists of somewhat similar components or very different ones. A practical measure is
the number of software products installed or the number of vendors delivering these products
to an HIS. We denote a homogenous (sub-)HIS, that is, a (sub-)HIS with software from only
one vendor as “V'.” Consequently, independent of the number of application components,
V'-HIS use only software products that all come from the same vendor. On the contrary,
heterogeneous HIS comprise software from several vendors; they are denoted as “V™.”
#142 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Obviously, (DB!, V') architectures are more common than (DB!, V") architectures.

An (AC", V") architecture where the different application components are based on
software from different vendors is commonly denoted as “best-of-breed,” pointing to the
fact that the hospital combines the “best” software products from different vendors. This
best-of-breed architecture is typically DB".

On the contrary, a monolithic (AC!, V!) architecture and even an (AC", V') architecture
emphasizes that the hospital selected only one product from only one vendor to support
as many hospital functions as necessary. This homogeneous architecture is also called
“all-in-one”.

6.5.1.4
Communication Pattern: Spaghetti Versus Star

Application components being part of an AC" architecture have to be connected to achieve
integration. One way would be to directly connect those application components that need
to exchange certain patient-related data.

For example, if data about the entity types patient and case are needed in the patient
administration system, in the RIS, and in the LIS, direct communication interfaces between
these components seem to be a possible solution. Hence, a communication interface allow-
ing for the transfer of patient data between the patient administration system and the RIS
may be introduced. Consequently, when connecting several application components, this
will lead to an increasing number of bidirectional communication interfaces. This architec-
ture is called “spaghetti” style. All these different interfaces must be supported and man-
aged. As the number of application components rises, the number of interfaces grows
nearly exponentially. The maximum number of communication interfaces between n
application components (n 22) is ¥ x.
‘We denote architectures with this “spaghetti-styled” communication pattern as “CP"™.
Figure 6.47 presents a (DB", AC", V", CP") architecture.

To reduce the large number of interfaces, one can use smarter methods and tools to
organize and realize the interoperability of application components — that is, middleware
approaches (see Sect. 6.5.5.3).

For example, most HIS following the DB” style use a communication server. By using
a communication server, no direct interfaces between application components are needed.
Interfaces are needed only between the application components and the communication
server. The number of interfaces that must be managed can consequently be low — ideally,
only n interfaces exist for n application components.

‘We call this style “star architecture” and denote it as “CPL.” Figure 6.48 presents a
(DB", AC", V", CP") architecture. Note that star architectures do not necessarily contain
communication servers, as the center of the star may also be a database. Consequently
(DB!, AC") architectures will also be CP! architectures. Furthermore, we may call a SOA
with one application component serving as a broker or as a service bus a CP! architecture
as well. But for AC! this concept obviously does not make sense and neither CP' nor CP"
should be applied.

6.5.2
Integrity

In a HIS, integrity in the broadest sense is understood to mean the correctness of the data
stored in the HIS. Object identity, referential integrity, and consistency are important con-
ditions for integrity in HIS.

6.5.2.1
Object Identity

Object identity comes from object-oriented programming and means that an object has an
existence that is independent of its value. Thus, two objects may look the same, that is,
have the same value, but be different. Applying this to the representation of entity types in
a database leads to the requirement that the representation of every entity must be uniquely
identifiable. In a HIS, this is especially important for entity types like patient and case but
also for finding, order, and all other entity types. This identity is needed, since all medical
data need to be assigned to a particular patient and his or her cases.

Experience has shown that object identity of the entity type patient can be guaranteed
only when every patient receives a unique number, the PIN. The PIN should have no inter-
nal meaning. That is, it is created continuously and is usually numerical. Past attempts to
generate a PIN from data collected from the patient, for example, from the date of birth and
the name, have led to considerable problems that absolutely need to be avoided. Problems
that arise include, for example, if a date of birth is corrected, the PIN must also be changed.
In this case, object identity could be compromised.

Similar actions should be taken for the entity type case. A CIN, which should also have
no apparent meaning, should be assigned for every case. A CIN cannot change, as opposed
to the PIN, whose relation to a patient must be corrected after a misidentification has taken
place. However, after the correction of a misidentification of a patient, it may be necessary to
assign a particular CIN to a different patient. If all application components of the HIS guar-
antee that a case identified with a CIN is always assigned to the correct patient in its database,
then the CIN can be used as a distinguishing identifier for the patient. For example, during
order entry the case identifier is used to uniquely identify a patient on the forms requesting,
for example, laboratory testing. Then, for example, the LIS can use its database system to
relate the CIN to the PIN, and thereby find the patient’s data. It must be assumed, though, that
the actual assignment of the case identifier to the PIN was communicated to the LIS.

Assigning a PIN and a CIN to a patient is part of the hospital function patient identifica-
tion and checking for recurrent, which is a subfunction of patient admission.

In a hospital, a patient will receive his or her PIN during the first visit. This PIN has to
be used in all parts of the hospital for the identification of the patient and will be used dur-
ing future visits. Since PIN and CIN are assigned during patient admission, only one
admission has to be performed and only one PIN has to be assigned to the patient during
his or her visit. This works well if there is exactly one dedicated application component
supporting patient admission, namely the patient administration system. The patient
administration system must have direct access to a database that holds data allowing the

data modelCase

Order 1 1 Finding

reidentification of all past patients and cases in the hospital. To have this MPI as part of the
patient administration system is an obvious choice.

6.5.2.2
Referential Integrity

Referential integrity means the correct assignment of entities, for example of cases to a
certain patient, or results to the cases, (see the UML diagram in Fig. 6.49). Object identity
is needed for referential integrity. Thus findings and orders need strict appliance of unique
identifiers as well as patient and case.

Ensuring object identity for patients and cases is the basic duty of a HIS, regardless of
whether it is computer-supported or not. Without object identity there is no referential
integrity, and without referential integrity it cannot be ensured that results can be related
back to the correct patient. Without the correct distribution of the PIN and CIN, the instal-
lation of communication networks and computer systems is practically useless.

6.5.2.3
Consistency

In DB"-styled information systems patient data and data of other objects are often stored
redundantly, that is, there are copies of data representing the same information about one
particular object. Obviously these copies are supposed to be identical at all sites where
they are stored. In other words, even redundant data must not be contradictory. We denote
this type of integrity consistency. However, if the data are not identical and thus represent-
ing contradictory information, we call these data inconsistent. These potentially inconsis-
tent copies of the same data are called duplicates. Transaction management (see
#146 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Sect. 6.5.5.2) tries to make sure that data are consistent — we then talk of replicates, mean-
ing that copies of data are automatically held consistent. In DB! architectures, no redun-
dant data exist as all data are unicates.

6.5.3
Types of Integration

Even if the application components at the logical tool layer are linked (or networked)
together through interfaces in order to cooperate, there may be different types of integra-
tion. In the following paragraphs, we will introduce seven types of integration, namely
data integration, semantic integration, access integration, presentation integration, contex-
tual integration, functional integration, and process integration.

6.5.3.1
Data Integration

Data integration is obtained in a HIS when data that have been recorded are available
wherever they are needed, without having to be reentered. Thus, each data item needs to
be recorded, changed, deleted, or otherwise edited just once — even if it is used in several
application components. Data integration reduces efforts to collect data, it helps to increase
the quality and consistency of data, and it helps to reduce unnecessary double examina-
tions. In DB" architectures, communication interfaces in the computer-supported part of
HIS are required, and ways to print out data (e.g., labels, order entry forms) or scan data in
order to provide communication between the computer-based and the non-computer-based
parts of HIS.

Assume your child was treated in the pediatrics department and a detailed patient his-
tory was collected and saved. Now, the child has to go for a hearing examination at the ear,
nose, and throat department of the same hospital. If the patient history needs to be collected
again because the document from the pediatrics department cannot be accessed, there is no
data integration. Data integration is possible even when data items are stored redundantly.

6.5.3.2
Semantic Integration

Like data integration, semantic integration is concerned with data. Semantic integration is
guaranteed if different application components use the same system of concepts, that is, they
interpret data the same way. For example, when the sending application component uses the
abbreviation “GOT” for a lab parameter, but the receiving application does not know this
code but uses “ASAT” instead for the same concept, then semantic integration is violated.
Semantic integration between different application components using different systems
of concepts can be achieved by implementing a mapping for the mutual translation of the
concepts between the different application components, or by using the same system of
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 147

concepts. An example for a system of concepts in medicine is the ICD (currently most
prevalent in version 10). If the same ICD10'° catalog is available in both the patient admin-
istration system and the RIS, then they interpret diagnoses in the same way and semantic
integration with respect to diagnoses is guaranteed. Other examples of systems of concepts
are SNOMED! for medical terms, ATC'? for medications, NANDA" for nursing diagno-
sis, LOINC" for encoding laboratory procedures, lab results, and diagnostic procedures,
and the UMLS metathesaurus'® which links different systems to each other.

Semantic integration can be supported by medical data dictionaries (MDDs) elegantly
and thoroughly. MDDs are central catalogs of medical concepts and terms that offer the
possibility of representing the semantic relationships among all data stored in a HIS, and
of linking that local vocabulary to internationally standardized nomenclatures and knowl-
edge sources. MDDs can be independent application components or part of existing appli-
cation components.

6.53.3
Access Integration

Access integration is guaranteed when the application components needed for the comple-
tion of a certain task can be used where they are needed. If, for example, the patient admin-
istration system is needed for patient admission, then the patient administration system
should be accessible at all workstations where patient admission has to take place: central
admission areas, wards, outpatient units, the radiological outpatient unit, emergency
department, etc.

6.53.4
Presentation integration

Presentation integration is guaranteed when different application components represent
data as well as user interfaces in a unified way. So, for example, different application com-
ponents at a workstation should display the name of the patient who is currently being
processed at nearly the same place on the interface, and icons for patients should code
gender with the same colors.

6.5.3.5
Contextual Integration

High quality of the HIS is achieved when data, semantic, access, and presentation integra-
tion are realized. However, at the workstation of a staff member the user and patient con-
text may get lost through the change from one application component to another. Contextual
integration means that the context is preserved when the application component is changed.
Or, more generally, the aim is that a task that has already been executed once for a certain
purpose, such as login to a component, or selecting a patient, does not need to be repeated
again in the information system, in order to achieve the same purpose.

Assume that a nurse first wants to order a lab examination for the patient Peter Maier
using the POE application component, before documenting certain nursing procedures in
her nursing management and documentation system. She would first login to the POE,
search the patient Peter Maier, and then order the requested examination. Then, without
context integration, she would have to start the nursing management and documentation
system, login again, and select again the patient before being able to document the nursing
procedures. Context integration would be achieved when both login (then also called “sin-
gle-sign-on”) and patient selection do not have to be repeated again, even when changing
the application component. A standard that supports context integration is Clinical Context
Object Workgroup (CCOW) (see Sect. 6.5.4.5 for details). In literature, this type of integra-
tion is also referred to as visual integration, where, however, emphasis is put on the fact that
the integration of application components within a graphical user interface is dealt with.

6.5.3.6
Functional integration

Functional integration means that features needed in several application components are
implemented only once and can be invoked by other application components. In a hospital,
coding of diagnoses and procedures, for example, is an enterprise function which should
be supported by the patient administration system, the operation management system, the
RIS, the LIS, etc. The HIS would be functionally integrated with respect to coding of diag-
noses and procedures if only one application component (e.g., the patient administration
system) provides the features needed for coding diagnoses and procedures and all other
application components can invoke and use them. A current approach allowing for func-
tionally integrated information systems are SOAs (see Sect. 6.5.5.3).

6.5.3.7
Process Integration

Process integration is guaranteed when business processes are effectively supported by a set
of interacting application components. Typically, as we have seen, hospital functions are sup-
ported by many different, yet interrelated application components. A user thus has to use dif-
ferent application components for one task. For example, during radiological report writing,
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 149

the radiologist may need access to patient data in the CIS, the RIS, and the PACS. These com-
ponents should interact as transparently and smoothly as possible. This means that all integra-
tion qualities introduced so far contribute to different extents to process integration. For
example, data integration avoids the need for the user to reenter available data; access integra-
tion makes sure that he has the needed tools available for his tasks; and context integration
reduces the need for double login and patient selection in different application components.
Additionally good process integration prevents users from transcriptions and media cracks
(see Sect. 4.5). Altogether, process integration describes a situation where different compo-
nents cooperate in an optimal way, so that business processes are best supported.

6.5.4
Standards

Regardless of the technology for integration used application components have to com-
municate if they shall be integrated. A consensus must exist about the syntax and semantics
of the data and messages that are to be exchanged. Costs of the implementation and running
of communication links can be significantly reduced when standards are put in place.

For health information systems there are communication standards, documents, and
health record standards available. The most important standards for communication inside
HIS are HL7, DICOM, and CCOW. While HL7 and DICOM mainly support data integra-
tion, CCOW is a means for enabling contextual integration. For the exchange of bio-signals
and vital parameters between point-of-care devices the ISO/IEEE'® family of standards is
available. These standards also support data integration. IHE provides guidelines for apply-
ing HL7 and DICOM properly but does not consider itself to be a separate standard. Like
the other communication standards EDIFACT supports data integration but is focusing on
message exchange between health care institutions. CDA is a standard for structuring med-
ical documents and contributes to data integration, but in combination with the systems of
concepts mentioned in Sect. 6.5.3.2 it contributes to semantic integration as well.

6.5.4.1
Health Level 7 (HL7) Version 2

Health Level Seven (HL7)"" Version 2 is the most implemented communication standard
in HIS for the transfer of messages with data about the entity types patient and case and the
other entity types of Sect. 6.2, but excluding image data. It has been developed by the HL7
organization. HL7 describes events and dedicated message types that are exchanged
between application components.

HL7 assumes that a message is sent from application component A to another applica-
tion component B through the occurrence of an event (see Fig. 6.50). The message type

that is used for the message depends on the occurring type of event. It describes the struc-
ture of the sent message and determines the meaning of the individual parts of the message
(see Sect. 5.3.3).

Following the arrival of the message, application component B confirms the receipt of
the message through a receipt message (ACK) that is sent back to application component
A. If a communication server such as the one described in Sect. 6.5.5.3 is used to send a
message from the patient administration system to the LIS, then the communication server
first takes over the role of the receiving application component B. As a second step, the
communication server as the sending application component A sends the message to LIS,
which takes over the role of B.

HL7 possesses an extensive catalog of event types. For example, AO1 describes the
event “admission of a patient,” A02 “transfer to another organizational unit,” A03 “dis-
charge of a patient,” and R01 “completion of an examination result.”

In addition, HL7 provides a list of standardized message types, such as ADT for mes-
sages related to admission, discharge, and transfer of a patient. Other message types are

ORM for a general order message (e.g., ordering a radiological examination), ORU for an
unsolicited observational result (e.g., a radiology report), and BAR for a patient account-
ing message.

Message types are assigned to event types. For example, if the LIS in the laboratory of
a hospital registers the occurrence of an event of type ROI, then it can send a message of
message type ORU.

All HL7 V2 messages are structured into segments, with each segment containing
fields. For example, the ADT message contains at least the following segments: Message
Header (MSH); Event Description (EVN); Patient Identification (PID); Patient Visit
Information (PVT). With each segment, the relevant information is provided in different
fields, each of them separated by “|”. The following example shows a very simplified pat-
tern of an ADT message where a patient is admitted to a specified ward:

MSH|SENDING COMPONENT|RECEIVING COMPONENT|DATE OF MESSAGE]
PVN|AO1|DATE OF EVENT]

PID[PATIENT IDENTIFIER [NAMEAFIRST NAME[BIRTH OF DATE|SEX]
PVIPATIENT CLASS|WARD ID|DATE OF ADMISSION]

Despite this standardization, the use of “plug and play” equipment is often not possible due
to various reasons. On the one hand, HL7 leaves users with freedom with regard to the
definition of terms, that is, the concepts, to be conveyed. In this case, consensus must exist
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 151

between the communicating application components, whether, for example, the choices
“male,” “female,” “other,” and “unknown” for gender can be documented as “m,” “f,” “0,”
and “wu,” with “0,” “1,” “2,” and “3,” or in some other fashion. On the other hand, manu-
facturers of software products sometimes offer HL7 interfaces to their products that cannot
send or receive all required event types and/or all necessary message types. In this case, a
thorough analysis is necessary before deciding on a purchase. For existing implementa-
tions, there furthermore exists the problem of the comparison of catalogs. For example, if
a CIS wants to order a radiological examination, it must have an up-to-date copy of the
service catalog of the radiological unit. Finally, there exist different subversions of HL7
V2(2.1,2.2,2.3, 2.4, 2.5) which partly differ in their definition of message content.

‘When a message was constructed in accordance with the previous explanations, it is up
to the particular implementation as to how communication between the physical data-
processing systems will occur. A message can then, for example, be written in a text file or
can be transported by a disk or through an FTP file transfer. The exchange format and
protocol on the physical tool layer is to be decided on in every single data transmission
connection.

6.5.4.2
Health Level 7 (HL7) Version 3

Health Level 7 Version 3! is the newest version of HL7. Unlike version 2, which was
developed in a rather pragmatic way, messages in version 3 are derived from a well-
defined information model, the so-called HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM),"
leading to much more precisely defined message semantics and a finer-grained message
structure (i.e., less optional fields in each message definition). The message encoding is
based on XML. The following example? shows a very simplified extract of an HL7 V3
message, representing a lab result message. The elements specify the type of observation
(glucose), the ID, the time of the observation, and the status (the observation is com-
pleted). The value for the actual result is shown in the value element, and the data type is

#152 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Since HL7 version 3 is not compatible with version 2, and a “translation” between both
formats is not trivial, version 3 has seen only limited uptake in those fields where version
2 is already successfully established. HL7 Version 3 is primarily used for transinstitutional
message exchange for which version 2 is not well suited. Both HL7 versions can be
expected to coexist for a long time.

6.5.4.3
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)

Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)*' is a standard maintained
by the International DICOM Committee that addresses the integration requirements of
the medical imaging sector. The standard comprises file and message formats for all
types of medical imaging modalities (e.g., computed tomography, digital x-ray, mag-
netic resonance imaging, ultrasound, nuclear medicine imaging, etc.), a network proto-
col (see Sect. 6.7.2), and a set of well-defined services. These services permit, for
example, an imaging modality to retrieve a “worklist” describing the patients to be
examined from the RIS, to transmit the images and x-ray dose information created dur-
ing an examination to the PACS, to confirm that the images have been archived success-
fully (and can thus be deleted locally), and to notify the RIS that the imaging procedure
has been completed. Other services permit an application component supporting image-
based diagnostics at a respective workstation to retrieve current and prior imaging stud-
ies, to print a hardcopy on a medical printer, or to store a report and results of
measurements performed on the images. Unlike HL7, the DICOM standard defines a
complete network protocol stack (based on TCP/IP, see Sect. 6.7.2) using efficient binary
encoding and optionally image compression techniques. The capabilities of two systems
(such as the services and encodings supported by both sides) are dynamically negotiated
whenever a new network connection is initiated, which permits a tight integration
because systems can to some degree adapt to the capabilities of their communication
peers. DICOM has gained widespread acceptance in the medical imaging sector and all
medical disciplines heavily relying on digital images (in particular radiology and
cardiology).

It should be noted that the RIS application component (see Sect. 6.4.8) is also dependent
on messages from the patient administration system and must also send, for example, bill-
ing data there. As discussed above, this communication should be carried out on the basis
of HL7. Orders from wards and outpatient units will also most likely reach radiology as
HL7 messages, whereas the results and images will come back as DICOM messages. The
common initiative Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)? (see below) has taken on
the task of settling this complex interplay.

6.5.4.4
1SO/IEEE 11073

The ISO/IEEE® family of standards defines a communication protocol for the exchange of
bio-signals and vital parameters between various point-of-care devices. Furthermore, the
standard enables a dynamic exchange and reconfiguration of devices and remote control,
for example, of infusion pumps. The protocol can be used to display data from infusion
pumps, respirators, ECG, etc. on patient monitors in the intensive care unit, but also for
personal health applications. ISO/IEEE 11073 defines a complete communication protocol
stack, with various cabled or wireless options on the lower layer, and a binary encoding
optimized for near real-time transmission and small embedded devices on the upper layers,
thus enabling a true “plug and play” operation.

6.5.4.5
Standard for Contextual Integration

Contextual integration requires the synchronization of application components at the
workstation. The “Clinical Context Object Workgroup” (CCOW)* has developed stan-
dards for the synchronization of application components of different vendors on one client
computer. In one of the first versions of the standard, a process, referred to as “Patient
Link”, is described for the synchronization of application components with regard to a
chosen or identified patient. When the user of an application component changes the cho-
sen patient at the client, all other application components on this client follow this change.
This is amended through a process that passes the data about the patient to the other appli-
cation components.

A similar method is used to eliminate annoying multiple user logins for different appli-
cation components by passing data about user authorization to the other application com-
ponents when the user has logged in at an involved application component (“single
sign-on”).

It can be expected that CCOW will see increasing acceptance, especially in (AC", V")
architectures.

6.5.4.6
Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise {IHE)

Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (THE)? is an organization founded by medical pro-

fessional societies together with the health care IT industry with the aim of improving the
interoperability of application components in health care (in particular within the hospi-
tal). The approach taken by IHE is to analyze typical work processes occurring in health
care, and to identify the application components involved in these processes as well as the

Zhttp://www.ihe.net/
#154 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

information that should be exchanged between these application components to support
the diagnostic and therapeutic processes as well as possible. THE then selects existing
standards, that is, especially HL7 and DICOM, for each “transaction” (information
exchange between application components) and restricts the options offered by these stan-
dards for each transaction such that plug-and-play interoperability becomes possible. [HE
furthermore offers comprehensive test software enabling vendors to test their products’
interfaces for IHE compliance and organizes large cross vendor testing events called “THE
connect-a-thon” (from “connection” and “marathon”). THE is not a standards body as
such, but fills a very important gap by selecting the most appropriate set of standards for
a typical clinical workflow. It reduces the indeterminacy of the way of interaction, for
example, between HL7 and DICOM, by proposing clear rules for their joint use. The
resulting technical specifications are published annually as the “IHE Technical
Framework.”

6.5.4.7
Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (EDIFACT)

EDIFACT? is a message format developed and maintained by the United Nations Centre
for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (CEFACT) as a standard format for elec-
tronic data interchange in electronic commerce (e.g., purchase orders, dispatch/delivery
information, and inventory reports). EDIFACT somewhat resembles HL7 version 2: it
specifies a message format, not a complete protocol stack (see Sect. 6.7.2), and the mes-
sage format is text-based, using segments containing a list of elements each, separated by
separator characters defined at the top of the message. The European Committee for
Standardization (CEN) has developed a number of standards for message interchange
based on the EDIFACT syntax, including messages for the exchange of laboratory infor-
mation (EN 1613), patient transfer and discharge (EN 12538), and request and report mes-
sages for diagnostic service departments (EN 12539).

In health care, EDIFACT is mostly used for communication between health care institu-
tions in transinstitutional HIS or between health care institutions and business partners.
Within institutions other communication standards such as HL7 version 2 are used
instead.

6.5.4.8
Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)

Also derived from the HL7 RIM (see Sect. 6.5.4.2) is an HL7 document format called the

Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). Unlike HL7 messages, CDA documents are per-
sistent records of medical information (such as diagnostic reports, discharge summaries, or

lab reports), also based on an XML encoding. CDA supports free text as well as fully

Zhttp://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/welcome.htm
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 155

structured, machine-processable information. Document templates (so-called implementa-
tion guidelines) define CDA-based document structures for specific use cases such as a
discharge summary or a radiology report (see also Sect. 6.4.13).

6.5.5
Integration Technologies

To achieve integration within DB" architectures, several integration technologies are used
within a HIS. For closer coupling of application components, we will first introduce feder-
ated database systems. For looser coupling, we will look at the possibilities of transaction
management in DB" architectures and then introduce middleware approaches such as
asynchronous communication by communication servers, synchronous communication by
remote function calls/remote procedure calls, and SOAs and portals.

6.5.5.1
Federated Database System

A federated database system is an integrated system of autonomous (component) database
systems which are part of respective application components. The point of integration is to
logically bring the database schemata of the component database systems to a single data-
base schema, the federated database schema, in order to attain data integration even when
there are redundant data in HIS with a DB” architecture. This virtual federated database
schema should be able to be accessed by application components as though it were a real
database schema.

‘When a federated database system has been implemented for a given set of application
components, software can be developed that can have read access and, if applicable, write
access on the corresponding data described by the federated database schema. This has a
major consequence.

This method allows for developing new application components “on top” of existing
ones. The existing ones are sometimes called “legacy systems.” If the aim is to continu-
ously use the legacy systems by their users as before, this is not an appropriate means for
realizing data integration between these legacy systems. This holds because the integra-
tional effect is only achieved at the new application component “on top” of the existing
legacy ones. Hence the use of the method of federated database systems should be restricted
to situations, when new application components, which shall reuse data out of legacy sys-
tems, are implemented.

6.5.5.2
Transaction Management: 2-phase commit protocol and master application components

Transaction management in databases but also in sets of distributed databases ensures that
every update of data, which are consistent, will lead to another state in which data are
#156 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

consistent again. This turns out to be not trivial especially for complex update operations,
so-called transactions. It is even more complicated in settings of more than one database
than in DB" architectures. Transaction management guarantees consistency of data (see
Sect. 6.5.2.3) by atomicity, isolation, and durability of any transaction (ACID conditions).
Atomicity guarantees that either all of the tasks of a transaction are performed or none of
them are; isolation makes intermediary updates of data inside the transaction invisible and
durability stands for persistence of the transaction’s results.

The “2-phase commit protocol” was developed for transaction management in DB”
architectures. In the initial phase, this protocol checks if the transaction can be carried out
by all affected database systems. Only if the changes are possible everywhere, they are
actually carried out in a second phase in all database systems. For carrying out the proto-
col, the database systems must be tightly coupled by synchronous communication, and the

database schemata of all involved database systems must be known. For an application
component in a HIS this means that an interface must be provided where changes as well
as the cancellation of these changes are possible. This is not the case for commercial appli-
cation components available today. Generally, the individual database schemata of each
component are also not known.

Due to these reasons, the 2-phase commit protocol to ensure consistency has usually not
been implemented within a HIS yet. Nevertheless, to guarantee consistency the following
more asynchronous approach is typically chosen within a HIS.

For every redundantly stored entity type, an application component is determined as the
master application component for this entity type. Thus, data about entities of this type can
only be inserted, deleted, or changed in this master application component. For example,
typically the patient administration system is master for the entity types patient and case.
Consequently data about patients and cases can be created, deleted, or changed only in the
patient administration system. Therefore this application component is sometimes called
the “leading system”.

Transactions in a database of the master application component are carried out without
regard to whether the corresponding operations can also be (immediately) carried out in
the databases of the other affected application components. Patient admission is thereby
carried out through the patient administration system independent of, for example, what is
going on in the RIS. It may happen that the RIS is not capable of inserting corresponding
data about the patient or case which have been sent by the patient administration system
into its database at the same point in time. The RIS is then obliged to catch up on database
operations at a later point in time.

6.5.5.3
Middleware

The very basis for integration is proper communication between application components.
In this section we will explain the most important methods and tools used for communica-
tion and thereby achieving integration of HIS with a DB" architecture.

Generally the term middleware describes the software components of a computer-based
information system that serve for the communication between application components.
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 157

Middleware can be considered as the “glue” in between application components, that is, in
the “middle” of a set of components.

Message Exchange by Communication Servers

A quite simple way of communication between application components is the asynchro-
nous exchange of messages. Asynchronous communication means that the application
component sending a message will continue its tasks without interruption even when
awaiting a response message from the communication partner. Message exchange gener-
ates queues of messages that have to be managed. Besides direct, point-to-point communi-
cation between two application components, middleware tools for managing message
queuing can be used. These so-called queue managers support the sending of messages
from the sender to the receiver and the distribution of a single message to numerous receiv-
ers (multicasting).

In HIS, queue managers are typically referred to as communication servers. A com-
munication server is an application component standing at the center of the logical tool
layer of a HIS (see Fig. 6.44 in Sect. 6.5.1.1). Corresponding software products are offered
by different manufacturers. This architectural principle can be found in most HIS with the
DB” architecture.

Generally speaking, a communication server is used for the asynchronous sending,
receiving, and buffering of messages. It can also be used to monitor the traffic between
application components. An application component can relay or send a message to the
communication server over its communication interface. The communication server will
then relay the message to the one address or many addresses (multicasting) when these
application components are ready to receive. In the meantime, the communication server
buffers the sent messages in a queue (message queuing).

In the case that the receiving application component is awaiting messages in a different
format than the sending application component sends, the communication server can trans-
late the sent message.

The communication server is in this way a tool with which asynchronous communica-
tion can efficiently be supported in order to provide data integration in a HIS of (DB", AC")
architecture. It supports a rather loose coupling between autonomous application compo-
nents. Specific application components can be more easily exchanged, thus supporting the
expandability of the HIS architecture. Furthermore, communication servers prevent (DB",
AC") styled HIS from spaghetti architectures and support CP' architectures.

With the communication server software available today, message sending can also be
done as synchronous communication (see next section). For this, the communication server
is configured so that the sending application component is blocked from the time that it
sends a message to the time that it receives a response message. This way, communication
servers can be used to provide functional integration as well.

Applying a communication server in order to integrate application components as in
Sect. 6.4 (see Fig. 6.51) is popular in many hospitals worldwide.

The application components have to provide communication interfaces for sending
and/or receiving messages to/from the communication server. As can be seen in Fig. 6.51

the PACS is typically connected to the RIS directly, that is, without using the communica-

tion server. While communication to/from the communication server is usually based on

HL7 or proprietary formats being able to translate to HL7, the communication between

RIS and PACS is based on DICOM.

In HIS with DB" architecture and redundant data storage the application components
store all the data needed for supporting their enterprise functions by themselves. This holds
especially for data about the entity types patient and case. Consequently the communica-
tion server is used to ensure that every application component will find these data in its
database system whenever the data will be used without needing to request for these data
in some central database system. Therefore the following communication processes are of
utmost importance:

After patient admission:

1. If the enterprise function patient admission has been performed at a certain time for a
certain patient, this results in an event called “A01” by HL7. Since the patient adminis-
tration system is a master application component for the entity types patient and case,
patient admission is exclusively supported by the patient administration system (see
Sect. 6.5.5.2).

2. In case of “A01” the patient administration system arranges data about the entity types
patient and case in a message, for example, according to the rules of HL7.

3. The patient administration system sends the message to the communication server.
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 159

4. The communication server multicasts this message to all application components,
which may need data about the entity types patient and case during the stay of the
admitted patient. Usually this holds for nearly all application components of the
HIS.

5. All application components receiving the message will store the data about the entity
types patient and case in their database system in order to have them ready in case
they are needed.

After update of data during performing any other enterprise function:

6. Since the patient administration system is a master component of patient and case, all
updates of related data have to be done using the patient administration system.
Updating data about patient and case results in an event called “A08” by HL7.

7. In case of “A08” the patient administration system arranges the updated data in a mes-
sage, for example, according to the rules of HL7.

8. The patient administration system sends the message to the communication server.

9. The communication server multicasts this message to all application components,
which already received data about the entity types patient and case. Usually this holds
for nearly all application components of the HIS.

10. All application components receiving the message will update the data about the
entity types patient and case in their database system according to the received mes-
sage. Afterwards data integrity is provided and application components will have
actual data ready in case they are needed.

Remote Function Calls

Middleware components for remote procedure calls (RPCs) or remote function calls
(RFC) enable the execution of a procedure that can run on a remote computer through
a process that is running on a local computer. Synchronous communication is thereby
carried out, meaning that the process in the initiating application component, follow-
ing the initialization of communication with another application component, is inter-
rupted as long as response data from the partner are not obtained. Using this method,
a user of one application component can use a procedure provided by another compo-
nent. For example, a user of the outpatient management system can use a procedure
supporting patient admission provided by the patient administration system. In this
example, the outpatient management system may call the function patient admission
of the patient administration system. As long as patient admission is not finalized, the
outpatient management system has to wait. After termination of patient admission,
the patient and case identifier may be communicated back to the outpatient manage-
ment system, and it can continue with the procedures (e.g., supporting patient
scheduling).

RPC and RFC are classical means for providing functional integration. They provide
a secure and technically well-supported way of synchronous communication between
closely coupled application components. However, the calling application component is
dependent on the successful response of the called component, and the exchange of an
#160 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

application component is typically more difficult than using asynchronous message
exchange.

Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) and Portals

In the history of system integration there have been several paradigms to describe how
application components exchange data and interoperate. As already discussed, earlier
approaches based on the idea to exchange messages and to invoke features of a remote
application component by remote function or procedure calls. In parallel to the paradigm
of object orientation in software engineering, system integrators as well considered appli-
cation components to be objects. Based on that understanding, application components
would provide so-called methods, which can be used in order to manipulate (data of)
certain objects.

The most recent paradigm is that of service orientation. It emerged in parallel to
the introduction of web services, which can be combined or orchestrated in order to
create new applications. In so-called service-oriented architectures (SOA) an appli-
cation component is considered to provide and/or to invoke services (compare
Sect. 5.3.4).

Some software products to support combination and orchestration of services are com-
mercially available. They are usually called integration platforms. Similar to communica-
tion servers, they are used both at construction time to construct integrated application
components and at run time to manage and control communication and interoperation
between connected application components.

Using integration platforms, portals can be constructed that not only allow access to
certain features, that is, services of the hospital's application components, but can also
retrieve data, compute it, and use the results as input for the invocation of another service
of another application component. Thus, especially functional, presentation, and contex-
tual integration can be achieved.

The more standardized the services and the more providing and invoking interfaces
are, the easier is the realization of the different integration qualities (Sect. 6.5.4) in a
HIS. In 2005 the Healthcare Services Specification Project (HSSP) was initiated as a
joint initiative between the Health Level 7 (HL7) organization and the Object
Management Group (OMG). Up to now the project defined functional specifications
through HL7 for four services: the decision support service; the entity identification
service; the clinical research filtered query service; and the retrieve, locate, and update
service. Technical specifications and commercial implementations have been developed
as well within OMG.

SOA is a promising approach for providing not only data integration and functional
integration but presentation integration and access integration as well.

‘Whether or not these standardized services and interfaces will be widely used in HIS in
future will depend on the marketplace. The question is, whether vendors are interested in
selling rather small application components providing standardized services instead of
“integrated information systems” as described in Sect. 6.4.15.
#6.5 Logical Tool Layer: Integration of Application Components 161

6.5.6
Logical Tool Layer: Example

6.5.6.1
Typical Realizations: Centralized, Monolithic and All-in-One HIS

The most effective (but not necessarily most efficient) strategy of reducing integration
efforts in a hospital is to strive for a HIS with one database, one application component,
and software from one vendor, that is, a (DB!, AC!, V!) or centralized, monolithic, and
all-in-one architecture. This strategy would enable to transfer the efforts for ensuring the
necessary types of integration (see Sect. 6.5.3) from the hospital to the software vendor or
developer. Experiences show that the centralized database, that is, the DB! architecture, is
the most important factor for reduced integration efforts.

DB! architectures have been the basis for the realization of the computer-supported parts of
some very successful HIS in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., DIOGENE of the University Medical
Center of Geneva, Switzerland). Those HIS first started with mostly self-developed computer-
based application components that facilitated easily connecting them in a DB! architecture
(DB!, V'). Nowadays you can hardly find “pure” DB!'-styled information systems.

Moreover, hospitals typically buy software products for their application components,
and they buy it from different vendors. Nevertheless, there are two typical situations where
software for particular components comes from the same vendor. In either case, the applica-
tion components will usually share the same database system. And thus the group of the
respective application components can be regarded as a subinformation system having (DB!,
V1) architecture. We will have a look at two typical situations of this in the next paragraphs.
Since (DB', V') architectures reduce integration efforts in the hospital significantly, vendors
often emphasize the lower integration efforts. They talk of an “integrated information sys-
tem,” meaning that their software already has tightly integrated modules supporting several
enterprise functions in more than one area and for more than one professional group.

One situation of a (DB!, V') architecture of a subinformation system is when the medi-
cal documentation system, the nursing management and documentation system, the outpa-
tient management system, and the POE are based on one software product from one vendor.
These four application components can be considered to be modules of a super component,
which is then often called (integrated) CIS (Fig. 6.52). In this case, the major medical
professional groups on all wards and outpatient units work with the same component that
presents the specific features for the different areas. This integration has the advantage that
major parts of the clinical data are available in one application component; this eases the
development of an EPR. An example is the CIS of Chiba University Hospital, Japan. In
Chiba, a MUMPS?’ database system has been used for a long time and even today a couple
of different application components access that database system. See Fig. 6.53 for Chiba
University Hospital’s DB!-styled subinformation system. Besides the central component,

called “EMR system” (electronic medical record system), it includes a patient administra-
tion system, a medical documentation system, a nursing documentation and management
system, and a POE, and is used both in inpatient and outpatient units of the hospital. The
application software for these components has been developed by one vendor especially
for Chiba University Hospital.

Another situation of a (DB', V') architecture of a subinformation system is when the
patient administration system and the enterprise resource planning system come from the
same vendor. This is a typical situation, as patient administration can then closely be
linked to financial accounting and controlling. See Fig. 6.54, which demonstrates that situ-
ation which is quite typical for German university hospitals.

These central, all-in-one (sub-)information systems help to reduce the effort for integra-
tion, but as drawback, hospitals tend to be more dependent on one or two major vendors.

Introducing a Departmental Computer-Based Application Component

The Department of Cardiology wants to buy and introduce a new cardiologic computer-
based application component for their wards and outpatient units. The hospital already has
an integrated CIS in use in other departments, but the Department of Cardiology argues
that this CIS is not sufficiently oriented toward the special needs of cardiology. If you had
to decide: Would you allow them to introduce a new specific cardiologic computer-based
application component, or would you recommend introducing the hospital-wide CIS
instead? Please justify your choice.

6.5.7.5
Loose and Close Coupling

Message sending is typically referred to as “loose” coupling, while remote function calls
are referred to as “close” coupling. Which type of coupling do you find more helpful when
you want to have an architecture where components can be easily exchanged? And which
type of coupling do you prefer when you want to have the RIS being able to support patient
admission as well, although the patient administration system already provides a related
feature and you want to avoid functional redundancy?

6.5.7.6
Integrating Nursing Documentation

Imagine you want to transfer administrative patient data from the patient administration
system to a nursing management and documentation system where they are needed to
identify patients. How would you realize this? Which standards for integration would you
chose? Explain your solution.

6.5.8
Logical Tool Layer: Summary

At the logical tool layer, a HIS comprises dedicated application components to support
hospital functions in different units of a hospital. Typically there are the following applica-
tion components:

patient administration system,

medical documentation system,

nursing management and documentation system;

outpatient management system;

provider/physician order entry system;

patient data management system,

operation management system,

radiology information system,

picture archiving and communication system,

laboratory information system,

enterprise resource planning system,

data warehouse system;

document archiving system.

An integrated clinical information system (CIS) combines several application components
such as a medical documentation system, an outpatient management system, a nursing
management and documentation system and a CPOE system in one component. CIS are
also often called electronic patient record (EPR) systems.
#168 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

Information managers have to keep in mind that besides computer-based application
components, even today there are a lot of important non-computer-based application com-
ponents such as the paper-based patient chart system and the paper-based patient record
system.

A major challenge for information management is to integrate these application com-
ponents in order to achieve and maintain integrity. In a HIS, object identity, referential
integrity, and consistency are important aspects of integrity. Since there are different ways
of integration and different constraints in different hospitals, different architectures of HIS
may result. A taxonomy taking the number of databases, number of application compo-
nents, number of software products, and communication patterns into account is helpful
for describing architectures.

Integration of application components encompasses different aspects such as data,
semantic, access, presentation, contextual, functional, and process integration. A well-
integrated HIS should implement all of them.

Using standards can reduce integration efforts and result in better reliability. In HIS,
communication standards like HL7, DICOM, ISO/IEEE 111073, and EDIFACT are of
outstanding importance for data integration. IHE defines how HL7 and DICOM can be
used in combination. CCOW supports contextual integration and CDA provides a standard
for structuring medical documents.

Several integration technologies are used within a HIS. The concept of federated data-
base systems can be used as a basis for the development of a new application component
in a HIS. This can be complemented by a 2-phase commit transaction management. Since
this is often not possible, master application components have to be defined in many cases.
According to the requirements, different middleware concepts are applicable to imple-
ment interfaces and communication. Communication servers are most popular but
often complemented by remote function calls. SOAs may emerge to replace these
technologies.Physical Tool Layer: Physical Data-Processing Systems

Application components are logical tools and they cannot exist without physical tools as a

basis. In an information system we can describe this basis by the physical data processing

systems at the physical tool layer. As said earlier physical data processing systems can be

human actors, non-computer-based physical tools, or computer systems. We will now

have a closer look at typical computer-based physical data processing systems in a

hospital.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

eo What computer-based and non-computer-based physical data processing systems can
be found in hospitals?

e What is meant by the term “infrastructure”?
#6.6 Physical Tool Layer: Physical Data-Processing Systems 169

6.6.1
Servers and communication networks

Servers are used to provide sophisticated features to clients (see Sect. 6.6.2). Servers can
run databases (database server), they can run the back-end part of application software
(application server), or support printing (printer server). Terminal servers run the front-end
part of application software, which traditionally has been implemented on and run by cli-
ents. If terminal servers are used, mere terminals (see Sect. 6.6.2) for displaying output and
receiving input are sufficient. Further server types are name servers (for DNS name man-
agement), DHCP servers (for dynamic IP assignment), mail servers (for e-mail services)
and web servers (for Web site management).

There is a strong trend to virtualize servers. One “real” server, that is, a physical server,
can simulate lots of so-called virtual servers. Every virtual server runs a particular instance
of an operating system and can be used to implement application software. Thus, these
virtual servers behave nearly identically to physical servers. This approach makes comput-
ing power in a computing center much more flexible and scalable. It fosters the use of large
multipurpose central computers instead of smaller departmental and dedicated servers in
the past (see also Sect. 6.7.1).

Virtual servers also result from coupling physical servers in order to maximize avail-
ability by redundancy. Those coupled servers are called a server cluster. It makes sense to
localize the members of the cluster at different sites of the computing center (see
Sect. 6.7.3).

Servers are part of, and connected by, larger intra- and interhospital communication
networks. Communication networks can be implemented by optical fibers, copper cables,
and wireless LAN technologies. Different communication protocols such as Ethernet or
token-ring can be used.

6.6.2
Clients

Clients comprise all data processing tools that are immediately available to the various

user groups within a hospital, for example:

® a stationary personal computer located at a defined place in a unit (e.g., the personal
computer in the ward office);

® a mobile computer such as a laptop or tablet-pc used for mobile information access
(e.g., a tablet-pc used by health care professionals on a ward) (see Fig. 6.60);

e mobile devices such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile phone to support
mobile personal organization and information access;

e aterminal (also called thin client) which has only functionalities for displaying and for
data entry, but has no storing capability;

® abeamer used for projecting radiological images onto a wall in order to support a con-
ference of physicians discussing a difficult case jointly (see Fig. 2.1).

6.6.3
Storage

Not only huge amounts of data but also very important data, which may be crucial for
patients” health and life, have to be stored in HIS (compare example 6.7.4.1). This needs
storage devices of high capacity and high reliability. Storage media used range from mag-
netic disks for random access to magnetic tapes and optical media for backup and
archiving.

Nowadays storage devices regardless of the media used are not specifically attached to,
and exclusively used by, certain servers. Moreover so-called storage area networks (SANs)
provide storage services of different kinds to all servers integrated in this network. This
technology allows for scaling up and down quite easily the storage capacities depending
on actual storage needs. Additionally, SANs support to maximize availability by redun-
dancy. It makes sense to localize the members of the SAN at different sites of the comput-
ing center (see Sect. 6.7.3).

6.6.4
Typical Non-computer-Based Physical Data-Processing Systems

Computer-based data processing systems such as servers and clients as described above
are often in the center of interest for information management. However, in typical institu-
#6.6 Physical Tool Layer: Physical Data-Processing Systems 7m

Fig. 6.61 Typical paper-based physical data processing systems

tions, a large number of non-computer-based physical data processing systems are also in
use. A clinical user may, for example, use pencil and paper, telephones, mobile phones,
pagers, typewriters, fax machines, and even fork lift and cars (e.g., for transportation of
patient records) as typical non-computer-based components (Fig. 6.61). Besides, paper-
based folders may be in use as basis for the paper-based patient record and the paper-based
patient chart (see Sect. 6.4.16 for details). It is important to take those non-computer-based
systems into account when building and managing a health information system — only
coordination of all tools will appropriately support the clinical and administrative business
processes.

6.6.5
Infrastructure

The set of all physical data processing systems in a health care institution is called the
infrastructure of its HIS. This infrastructure can be described by the overall number of
physical data processing systems, by the average number of physical data processing sys-
tems per unit (e.g., two personal computers and one laptop per ward), or per staff
member.

The infrastructure of a given HIS can comprise primarily paper-based physical data
processing systems, primarily computer-based physical data processing systems, or a mix-
ture of both. Typically, you will find such a mixture in hospitals.
#172 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

For example, a typical scenario could be the following: The infrastructure for a 1,500-
bed university hospital may comprise about 4,000 clients (personal computers) and 3,000
telephones. At least two to four personal computers and two laptops are usually installed
for use in each ward and outpatient unit (in intensive care units, there is one computer for
each patient’s room). Every physician may have access to a personal computer. One per-
sonal computer may also be available in each OR and for each member of the administra-
tive staff. At least two telephones may be available in each unit, and a mobile phone or
pager for approximately half of the staff members (mainly physicians).

Despite the fact that “Green IT” seems to be a commercial buzzword in current fairs
and far from the interest of academic medical informatics, it has a considerable impact on
medicine and health care. Taking the above-mentioned infrastructure into account, it needs
not only resources for administration, maintenance, and reinvestment, but also tremendous
energy. For the above-mentioned 4,000 clients we can assume a power consumption of
approximately 300 W for each PC. This results in a total consumption of approximately
1.2 MW (Mega Watt) for the PCs. For two redundant computing centers housing the serv-
ers an additional 0.5 MW have to be added. Altogether, this would be more than enough
power to heat 170 detached houses even in coldest winter times. It is quite easy to calculate
the considerable amount of annual costs resulting from the related energy consumption.
These numbers emphasize the need for close collaboration of information system planning
and facility management in technical departments in order to find solutions for energy
recycling, for example, to support hot water supply.Physical Tool Layer: Integration of Physical Data-Processing Systems

If application components, which exchange data and interact with each other, are installed

on different physical data processing systems at the physical tool layer, these physical data

processing systems have to communicate as well, that is, integration is needed. Similar to

the logical tool layer, we categorize architectures and discuss integration at the physical

tool layer.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e How can physical data processing systems be grouped and arranged in order to support
application components in an optimal way? What architectures can result?

e What is meant by physical integration?

eo How do modern computing centers look?

6.7.1
Taxonomy of Architectures at the Physical Tool Layer

There are no remarkable differences between the physical tool layer of a hospital and the
physical tool layer of any industrial enterprise. At both settings we can find clients, that is,
#6.7 Physical Tool Layer: Integration of Physical Data-Processing Systems 173

personal computers and terminals, servers, storing media, and communication networks.
And in both settings there are different ways of sharing tasks between clients (terminals,
PCs) and servers or mainframes. We continue our taxonomy of architectures taking this
aspect into account.

6.7.1.1
Distribution of Computing Power: Mainframes vs. Client-Server

From their beginnings in the middle of the twentieth century, computer-based HIS were
based on centralized mainframes in a computing center. In a mainframe architecture, all
computer-based application components are installed on one or multiple mainframe
system(s) to which various terminals are attached. The terminals cannot execute applica-
tions or store data, that is, they only serve for data input and output. Until the late 1980s
mainframe architectures had been predominantly in hospitals. We will refer to these 1-tier
architectures with one centralized physical data processing system as “T".”

Note that the architecture of the physical tool layer can be chosen independently of the
architecture of the logical tool layer. Thus, you can find for example (AC!, T') architec-
tures as well as (AC", T') architectures.

Since the 1990s mainframes have been considered as legacy systems, that is, they are
out of date. However, the concept of terminals as so-called thin clients has continued into
the era of client-server architectures.

In decentrally styled or so-called distributed physical tool layers, sets of clients and sets
of servers can share their tasks in different ways. This became possible with the coming up
of PCs, which could take over a part of program execution, which allowed for graphical
user interfaces (GUI), for example.

In a 2-tier architecture, there is a server that serves both as application and database
server. The program execution can partly or completely be given to the client PCs. We will
refer to these architectures as “T=.”

In a 3-tier architecture, there is a separate application server and a separate database
server. The database server is responsible for storing the data, and on the application
server the application components are installed and executed. This requires communi-
cation between the three components during runtime. We will refer to these architectures
as “T3.”

During the 1990s, the low costs of hardware have led to an increased use of client-
server architectures in hospitals, with various clients and servers distributed over different
units. However, these T? and T? architectures have engendered high costs for maintenance
and support of the servers and of the clients, and have made data security and server avail-
ability difficult to guarantee. To solve this problem, the different servers have been recen-
tralized in one computing center, hoping to reduce costs for server maintenance. A
collection of servers at one site also allows for the improvement of data security and avail-
ability (e.g., by clustering servers). In addition, hard disks and CD/DVD drives are often
removed from the personal computers as clients, in order to reduce costs for maintenance
and support of clients. Moreover, during the last years the number of PCs in client-server
architectures has decreased in favor of thin clients. Similar to the terminals of the
#174 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

mainframe era, thin clients are only used for data input and output, but they have enough
processing power for running a GUI In addition to a database server and an application
server, a terminal server is necessary (see Sect. 6.6.1). But if we again take the above-
mentioned strong trend towards virtualization into account, the differentiation into differ-
ent servers and server types becomes increasingly irrelevant. Moreover, the park of servers
and the storage area network in a computing center can be considered to be only one big
server. And hence we are back where we started decades ago: at T' architectures.

6.7.2
Physical Integration

The types of integration introduced in Sect. 6.5.3 relate to the logical tool layer and, more
precisely, to sets of computer-based application components. Let us supplement this cata-
log of integration types by physical integration.

Physical integration is guaranteed if there exists the physical communication network
for any kind of data exchange. In other words, physical integration between different phys-
ical data processing systems is a prerequisite for data integration between application
components.

Physical integration needs not necessarily be achieved by connecting different physical
data processing systems such as servers by a communication network (see Sect. 6.6.1). It
can also be achieved by installing two different application components on the same physi-
cal data processing system.

If different physical data processing systems have to be connected by a communication
network, the network topology has to be considered. In general, we can distinguish logical
and physical network topologies. Please note that both topologies correspond to the physi-
cal tool layer in the 3LGM metamodel.

There are six basic physical topologies:

e Bus: Every physical data processing system is directly connected to the shared trans-
mission medium called bus. There are no other active devices between the devices and
bus.

e Ring: Every physical data processing system has exactly two neighbors for communi-
cation purposes. Finally the physical data processing systems are interconnected to
form a ring. Data are passed from one system to the other in the same direction (either
“clockwise” or “counterclockwise”) as long as they reach their destination.

e Linear: Two physical data processing systems are interconnected in order to form a line.
Data are passed from one physical data processing system to the other as long as they
reach their destination.

e Star: All physical data processing systems are connected via a two-point connection to
a central system which handles data transmission.

e Tree: Practically speaking, the tree topology hierarchically connects two or more star
topology networks by connecting the central physical data processing systems.

® Mesh (partially connected or fully connected): Each physical data processing system is
connected with one or more devices; if each device is connected with all other devices
on the network the mesh is said to be fully connected.
#6.7 Physical Tool Layer: Integration of Physical Data-Processing Systems 175

By contrast, the logical topology is the way in which physical connections (topology) are
used or signals transmitted. The logical and the physical topology can be chosen indepen-
dently from each other. For example, Ethernet can physically be implemented on a physi-
cal Bus or Star topology but logically Ethernet is clearly a Bus topology. The same is true
for Token Ring which is logically a Ring but may physically be organized as a Star using
so-called Multi Station Access Units. Note as well that all these combinations of topolo-
gies at the physical tool layer can be combined with every communication pattern at the
logical tool layer as described in Sect. 6.5.1.4.

In order to best describe standards for data exchange on a network and their different
functions it is useful to consider the ISO/OSI reference model. This reference model pro-
vides a framework for describing communication between computers at seven levels.
Standards for the respective communication protocols such as TCP/IP are available for
each level. With respect to 3LGM? these seven levels interconnect the physical with the
logical tool layer of a HIS. Level 7 may be considered as the logical tool layer which cor-
responds to the name of the communication standard HL7 (see Sect. 6.5.4.1). A set of
protocols for each of the seven levels is called a protocol stack.

6.7.3
Computing Centers

Regardless of whether you choose a T!, a T?, or a T® architecture, the servers must fulfill
special requirements related to availability, stability, performance, maintainability, and
redundancy. When T? and T° architectures came up, servers in hospitals were often installed
near the departments where the application components running on these servers had to be
used. This was due to the lack of high-performance communication networks and relatively
low prices of these servers. The last years showed clearly that these solutions are not eco-
nomically sound. Hence there is a strong trend back towards centralized computing centers.
But note that this centralization goes well with any of the T', T% or T> architectures.

The reliability of the computing center with all its equipment and physical data process-
ing systems is the very basis for the reliability of the HIS as a whole. Although system
stability of application components deals with the quality of the software used, system
stability has to be enhanced by redundancy. However, redundancy is not needed at the
logical tool layer but at the physical tool layer.

Hence, computing centers are required providing at least two redundant sites, with mir-
rored servers and storage devices at each site, stable energy supply, high-capacity air-
conditioning, server rooms that are burglar-proof and disaster-proof, and effective means
for fire protection. Even if an information management department cares for an effective
backup, the continuous operation of the computing center by appropriate redundancy is of
utmost importance. It may need 3-4 weeks to restore image data from a PACS if the respec-
tive storage device has crashed and no mirrored, redundant device had been provided.

People working here need software tools for supervising proper operation of serv-
ers, communication network components, PCs and terminals, and the application com-
ponents running above these physical tools. See Fig. 6.62 for a computing center’s
server room.

6.7.4.1
The Amount of Data to Be Processed at a Hospital's Computing Center

The amount of digital data a hospital has to manage depends, for example, on the hospi-
tal’s size, the medical services offered, and the existing IT infrastructure. Let us consider
a particular university hospital with approximately 1,200 beds, which provides maximum
medical care and is also responsible for research and education.

The server infrastructure is operated at two different sites, that is, there is a redundant
computing center. Besides physical redundancy, virtualization is an important concept of
the server hardware at the university hospital. Currently, 40 terabytes of the storage area
network (SAN) are needed for the server infrastructure. Services for the CIS and the ERP
system, exchange services, non-DICOM images and a variety of other application compo-
nents are implemented or stored on these servers. Backup is done with a deduplication
appliance using 20 terabytes at each site and a compression rate of 6:1.

For imaging during radiologic diagnostics, three image servers, each having 4 terabytes
of fast cache, are available. Tape libraries with a current volume of 100 terabytes are used
for long-term archiving of radiologic images. The estimated medium-term capacity
amounts to 230 terabytes.

The overall data volume is expected to grow by 10-15 terabytes a year. It is hard to
estimate this number more precisely because the modalities and, thus, the images
#6.7 Physical Tool Layer: Integration of Physical Data-Processing Systems 177

generated get more sophisticated. Additionally, each single user’s demand for storage
space grows rapidly.

gies are used?

e How many sites does the computing center have? Do they have more than one comput-
ing center?

e How are findings transported from laboratory to the ward physically?

6.7.6
Physical Tool Layer: Summary

At the physical tool layer, a HIS comprises data processing systems which are quite similar
to those of information systems of enterprises in other industries. Consequently, similar
servers, clients, and communication networks connecting them can be found. But espe-
cially in health care institutions non-computer-based data processing systems such as pen-
cil, telephone, and paper-based patient charts are still of considerable importance. And
presumably they will be. The set of all data processing systems in a health care institution
is called its information system’s infrastructure.

Similar to the components of the logical tool layer the physical data processing systems
of the physical tool layer have to be integrated. And again there are different ways and
styles to do this. The taxonomy of architectures as introduced for the logical tool layer
therefore has been expanded to cover 1-, 2-, or 3-tier physical architectures as well.
Physical integration roughly means that data can be exchanged between physical data
processing systems.

A well-organized computing center consisting of two redundant sites is the very prereq-
uisite to ensure availability, stability, and performance for the computer-supported part of
a HIS.

6.8.1
Health Information Systems Supporting Clinical Business Processes

In this example, typical activities and processes during a patient’s stay in the Plétzberg
Medical Center (PMC) and Medical School (PMC) are described by means of a fictional
example. It is demonstrated how clinical business processes can be supported by advanced
HIS. This example presents a more dynamic view of the process starting at a physician’s
general practice and ending with discharge from PMC.

Patient Treatment at a Physician’s General Practice

Dr. Healthy, a physician in general practice, diagnoses the patient Tom Bender, 62 years
old, with a transient ischemic attack and suspected stenosis of the internal carotid artery,
based on the reported symptom of an amaurosis fugax — a transient blindness — on the left
side. He would like to hospitalize Mr. Bender for further examination and treatment.

‘While Mr. Bender is in the doctor’s consulting room, Dr. Healthy calls the nearest hospital,
the PMC, for the purpose of an admission. The physician carrying out the admission at PMC
consults a clinical guideline that shows that about 7 days of treatment will have to be planned.
He can see that a bed is vacant and proposes an immediate hospitalization. Dr. Healthy agrees.
The physician performing admission documents Mr. Bender’s name, date of birth, and the
diagnosis for hospitalization. Dr. Healthy gets an automatic confirmation of this appointment
which he prints out, along with further information on the PMC, for this patient.

Dr. Healthy selects recent clinical documents of his patient (e.g., a recent ECG and a list
of recently prescribed drugs) and marks them as “available” for the hospital physician. As
soon as Mr. Bender is at the PMC, the hospital physicians can access this information in
their CIS.

Administrative Admission
Mr. Bender arrives at the PMC and the employee in the patient administration department
sees that a reservation has been made and she admits Mr. Bender to the neurology depart-
ment as a new patient. Mr. Bender gets a wristband carrying a bar-code that can be used to
uniquely identify Mr. Bender. After completion of the administrative admission, Mr.
Bender is taken to his ward.

Arrival at ward

On the ward, Mr. Bender is welcomed by the nurse, Mrs. Weber. He tells her that he would
like to have a single room. Mrs. Weber can see from the ward monitor that a single room
is available, and brings him to his bed. The patient terminal at his bedside allows Mr.
Bender to access selected parts of his medical record. He can, for example, review the
ordered medications and his latest lab values. He can also access general medical informa-
tion for patients that have been checked for quality and clarity.

Nursing Admission
Mrs. Weber carries out the nursing admission. After talking to Mr. Bender, she defines the
relevant nursing diagnosis and then reviews the automatically proposed nursing care stan-
#6.8 Summarizing Example 179

dards that match the situation of Mr. Bender. She selects two standards and adapts them to
the situation of Mr. Bender. She also notes that Mr. Bender has false teeth and limitations in
movement.

Medical Admission

Dr. White, the attending neurologist, screens the available electronic information from Dr.
Healthy, the GP, and from other physicians who have treated the patient before. The most
important data from the medical history and the essentials on the previous treatment of
hypertension are automatically copied to the EPR. Dr. White reviews this information and
then conducts a physical examination of Mr. Bender. The findings that he dictates during
this examination are automatically transcribed and entered in the patient record.

Medical Care Planning and Order Entry

Dr. White then selects the clinical guideline “suspected stenosis” and, based on the diag-
noses of the patient, automatically gets a proposal for a treatment plan for the next days.
Based on this treatment plan, Dr. White confirms the proposed administration of heparin
from the standard spectrum of therapies that, in conjunction with the regular checking of
coagulation factors, shall be carried out. He also orders medications to treat the hyperten-
sion of the patient. Each of his medication orders is automatically checked for errors
such as overdosing, drug allergy or drug-drug interaction that may harm the patient. In
case of errors, the physician gets an alert message and a proposal for an alternative
medication.

In addition, Dr. White confirms and finalizes proposed orders for a color duplex sono-
graphic examination for the assessment of the stenosis, a cranial computed tomography for
exclusion of infarction, and a blood test to analyze blood lipid concentration and coagula-
tion factors.

During the ward round, Dr. White uses a tablet computer to instruct that, as a nursing
procedure, regular blood pressure measurements have to be taken, based on the informa-
tion he has on hand regarding the patient’s hypertension. He also orders a low-salt and
diabetic diet for Mr. Bender.

The nurse, Mrs. Weber, documents Mr. Bender’s meal request. The selection that is
available for him is restricted as a result of the diet that has been ordered, and the choice
of food is automatically adapted to the requirements of diabetes and hypertension.

Execution of Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Nursing Procedures

In the morning, Mrs. Weber prepares Mr. Bender's medication based on the medication
orders documented by the physician. She uses a drug-dispensing machine that automati-
cally prepares the drugs for Mr. Bender. To assure that the drugs are given to the correct
patient, she scans the barcodes of the drugs as well as the wristband of Mr. Bender before
giving him his medication.

Mrs. Weber reviews the series of further measures that have been ordered by the physi-
cian for her patient. She activates a reminding function to make sure that she does not
forget any of the regular blood pressure measurements that have been ordered.

The nurse prepares the catheter and the syringe for heparinization. Dr. White inserts the
catheter to which he connects the automatic syringe containing the prescribed dose.

During the period for which the checking of coagulation factors has been ordered,
a request for a blood test is automatically prepared every day and put into the worklist
of the responsible nurse, Mrs. Weber. She then takes the blood sample, adds a patient
#180 6 Architecture of Hospital Information Systems

label that she automatically gets printed, and then sends the blood sample to the
laboratory.

Mrs. Weber also orders color duplex sonographic and CCT examinations as requested
by the physician. On this occasion, she uses the automatic scheduling function to set up a
date for each examination. Those dates are automatically documented in the patient record,
sent to the transportation unit to organize the transport of the patient, and also made avail-
able to the patient for information. In addition, Mrs. Weber can easily review the status of
each order (ordered, scheduled, in progress, report being written, finalized).

Review of Findings

As soon as the results of the orders (lab report, CT report, CT images) are available, an
automatic note is put in the patient record to inform the treating physician. Findings not yet
reviewed are highlighted. The laboratory results can be displayed in various ways, for
example, by displaying the time line of selected lab parameters. Pathologic values are
highlighted. The CT report and the CT images, as well as results of earlier examinations,
can be displayed side by side. As far as the CT result is concerned, Dr. White can view a
reference x-ray image selected by the radiologist.

Decision Making

After having reviewed all findings, Dr. White decides that the stenosis should be removed
by vascular surgery. For support in his decision-making process, he can electronically
consult recommendations provided based on the clinical data of the patient and most recent
evidence-based clinical guidelines.

Stress and excitement about the forthcoming procedure leads to an increase in Mr.
Bender’s blood pressure, a circumstance realized by Dr. White during his ward round from
the profile of blood pressure values automatically shown on his mobile tool. He therefore
orders an increase in the dose of the antihypertensive drug. This change in medication is
recorded and will be taken into account during the next dispensing of medicine.

Organization and Scheduling of Patient Treatment

For scheduling of the surgical procedure, Dr. White contacts the Department for Vascular
Surgery of the PMC and discusses Mr. Bender's case with the surgeon, Dr. Sunny, on the
basis of all information contained in the EPR. They both agree on a date for the procedure.
Dr. Sunny uses the resource management functions to make the reservations for a bed and
OR. Dr. White orders, as an administrative measure, the transfer of Mr. Bender on the
agreed date.

Transfer to Another Department

On the date of transfer, Dr. White again reviews both Mr. Bender's therapy and the state of
health. He can easily limit the presentation to those values most relevant for this case,
which are coagulation factors, blood pressure, and diabetes control.

During his ward rounds, Dr. White confirms the transfer scheduled for that day.
Thereafter, all the services provided to the patient are ceased and documented for billing
purposes. A transfer service is requested for taking him to the department performing fur-
ther treatment.

The nurse automatically generates a final nursing report, based on the documented data,
which she completes and signs, using her health care professional card for authentication.
#6.9 Summarizing Exercises 181

The final nursing report, the epicrisis (on the treatment given by then), and other essential
documents are automatically made available to the Department for Vascular Surgery.

Discharge from Hospital and Aftercare

As the procedure engendered no complications, Mr. Bender remains in the surgical
department for a few more days of observation. The physician in the neurology depart-
ment is automatically informed about the outcome of the operation and the progress of
recovery.

Mr. Bender is discharged from the PMC a short time later. Before leaving the hos-
pital, Mr. Bender calls on the neurology department where the dates for postoperative
care are set up. A (standard) plan for aftercare is proposed to Dr. White which he,
together with Mr. Bender, adapts to the patient’s requirements and desires. To coun-
teract further progression of the atherosclerosis which caused the arterial stenosis,
Mr. Bender enters a rehabilitation exercise training program funded by his insurance
company. He is also equipped with a small wearable sensor device that monitors his
daily physical activity level and provides individualized feedback and training
recommendations.

After completing the measures requested for Mr. Bender and documentation of the
results, Dr. White dictates a discharge report that is automatically transcribed. He com-
pletes the document and electronically signs it. The report is then transmitted to his senior
physician for approval. The final discharge report is automatically transmitted to Dr.
Healthy, the referring physician.

All of the information required for billing is automatically extracted from the docu-
mented patient data. An invoice of the services supplied is automatically sent to the insur-
ance company.

After completion of the case, the EPR is archived in electronic form. Should Mr. Bender
be readmitted to the PMC for treatment at a future time, this archived information is imme-
diately available.Summarizing Exercises

Summary

The architecture of a HIS can be described using three interconnected layers.

At the domain layer we describe the information to be processed in a hospital as entity
types. There are entity types related to patient care, administration and management, and
resources. These entity types are interpreted and updated by hospital functions. Since the
HIS comprises all areas of a hospital, these functions do not deal only with patient care but
also with supply and disposal management, hospital administration, hospital manage-
ment, and research and education.

The logical tool layer presents the application components used to support the functions
and to store the data of the entity types. Typically there are a lot of different computer-
based application components in a hospital such as a patient administration system, a RIS,
and a LIS. Sometimes some of them are integrated to a so-called CIS. All these application
components form the basis of an EPR. But it shall not be forgotten that there are still non-
computer-based application components in hospitals.

A major challenge for information management is to integrate the different application
components. Here, integrity as well as different types of integration needs to be achieved.
Different standards such as HL7 or DICOM as well as integration technologies such as
middleware can reduce integration efforts. The architectures of a HIS can be described
based on the number of databases, the number of application components, the number of
software products, and the used communication patterns.

The physical data processing systems needed to install the application components on
are described at the physical tool layer. It turns out that this layer is not very specific for
hospitals, since servers, personal computers, and networks are also used in other indus-
tries. But again non-computer-based systems have to be taken into account at this layer.
Availability, stability, and performance of the overall computer-based part of the informa-
tion system significantly depend on a well-organized computing center.
##Specific Aspects for Architectures
of Transinstitutional Health

Information SystemsIntroduction

Although this book focuses on hospital information systems, it is important to understand
that institutional information systems, in general, and hospital information systems, in
particular, are parts of larger, cross-linked systems.

Given the demographic change in most countries we can assume that in future the
number of chronically ill patients will increase. The medical treatment of chronic dis-
eases typically involves many different actors over a long period of time, including hos-
pitals, medical practitioners, specialists of different medical fields, nurses of home care
services and even relatives. Since relevant information should be available whenever and
wherever it is needed, we need to understand and design transinstitutional information
systems (see Sect. 4.3) that efficiently support transinstitutional care processes, that is,
continuity of care.

Hospitals are the most complex institutions in health care and the architectures pre-
sented for their information systems are valid also for transinstitutional health information
systems. However, with the extension of our perspective beyond one institution, the com-
plexity raises and the challenges for health information systems (see Sect. 4.5) are even
intensified.

In this chapter, we first discuss the influences of these challenges to the three lay-
ers of transinstitutional health information systems. Since electronic health records
(EHRs) are the major concern of these systems, we will then introduce different strat-
egies on how to organize responsibility for these records in this highly distributed
environment.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e How do architectures of transinstitutional health information systems differ from those
of hospital information systems?

e What additional challenges do we have to cope with?

e Which strategies are appropriate for maintaining electronic health records in a transin-
stitutional health information system?

#186 7 Specific Aspects for Architectures of Transinstitutional Health Information SystemsDomain Layer

Since a transinstitutional health information system can be considered as the entirety of all
institutional information systems of a health care network (see Sect. 4.3), it has to support all
the enterprise functions to be performed in the member institutions. If hospitals are part of this
health care network, at least the hospital functions introduced in Sect. 6.3 have to be supported
and data about the entity types in Sect. 6.2 have to be stored, communicated, and processed.

But in the context of transinstitutional collaboration of health care providers, further
specific aspects have to be considered. Additional enterprise functions and entity types
have to be taken into account, if health insurances and governmental authorities are mem-
bers of a transinstitutional health information system.

7.21
Specific Aspects for Hospital Functions

7.2.1.1
Patient Admission

As mentioned in Sect. 6.3.1.1 patient admission, among others, aims at correctly identify-
ing each patient, and assigning a unique patient and case identifier (Fig. 7.1).

Considering a single health care institution, for example, a hospital, a patient will receive
his or her PIN during the first visit to the hospital. This PIN has to be used in all parts of the
hospital for the identification of the patient. Since PIN and CIN (case identification number)
are assigned during patient admission, only one admission has to be performed and only
one PIN has to be assigned to the patient during his or her visit. This works well, if there is
exactly one dedicated application component supporting patient admission, namely, the
hospital’s patient administration system with its master patient index (MPI).

In transinstitutional health information systems the situation turns out to be more com-
plicated. Object identity (see Sect. 6.5.2.1) can be guaranteed only if a patient will receive
his or her PIN during the first visit to one of the health care network’s institutions. Again
this PIN has to be used in all parts of the health care network for the identification of the
patient and will be used during future visits regardless of the visited institution. This could
simply be realized by using exactly one dedicated patient administration system through-
out the network. In many countries however, nationwide PINs have been or will be intro-
duced shortly. Usually, smart cards are used to bear these PINs. The PINs can be used
during patient admission instead of self-generated PINs and every institution can use its
own patient administration system for patient admission, if preferred. If both solutions are
not available, one master patient index for this transinstitutional health information system
should be used; see Sect. 7.3.1 for more details

Regardless the technology used, data recorded at patient admission and especially PIN
and CIN have to be made available to all enterprise functions needing them throughout the
transinstitutional health information system.

7.21.2
Decision Making, Planning, and Organization of Patient Treatment

Realizing that a hospital is part of a health care network provides new opportunities for
better and more efficient decision making, planning and organization of patient treatment,
and thus new chances for continuous and better care.

Quality of decisions on diagnoses and appropriate therapies can be improved by incor-
porating experts in other organizations into the decision process. Teleconsultations using
means for video conferencing and exchange of patient’s documents are more and more
used. Transfer of rights to access to the patient’s record in parallel to the patient’s path
from one care provider to the next and of course their ability to access the records are
prerequisites for this kind of joined decision making.

7.213
Execution of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures

In health care networks, not only can expertise in decision making be shared, but resources
for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are also shareable.

For example, a radiology expert in one hospital may supervise modalities at other hos-
pitals as well and be in charge of radiological diagnostics. She or he may do this by using
teleradiology equipment for digital transmission of image, finding, and worklist data.
#188 7 Specific Aspects for Architectures of Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

A pathologist in one hospital may examine tissue in other hospitals using telemicroscopy
technology. A small rural hospital may transport patients to the operation room of a second
hospital for some specialized surgical procedures but will care for recovery and rehabilita-
tion afterward.

7.22
Additional Enterprise Functions

As mentioned before, not only hospitals and other health care providers may be part of a
health care network and thus incorporated within one transinstitutional health information
system. Additional institutions may be health insurances and governmental authorities for
example. Besides their general administration functions, they have to perform specific
enterprise functions.

A health insurance company, for example, has to develop insurance plans, to advise its
clients, to receive and pay bills from hospitals and practitioners. More specifically they
have to take responsibility for disease management. That is to support their clients — the
patients — in finding a path, which is best suited for her or his special health care needs.
Performing functions like this, the insurance company needs a lot of data from attached
hospitals. This holds not only for entity types related to administration and management,
but also for those related to patient care (see Sect. 6.2). Additionally, these hospitals need
respective data from the insurance companies.

Governmental authorities, for example, have to care for the health care system as a
whole. Hence they take responsibility for the availability of health care providers of differ-
ent kind at any place in a region. They need data about incidence and prevalence of dis-
eases in order to plan for care resources meeting the needs of the people. In case of disasters
they have to coordinate help for the people involved. Furthermore they observe epidemio-
logic development of diseases in order to detect or better to prevent epidemics and pan-
demics. Diagnoses are therefore needed from any health care provider across all relevant
health care networks.Logical Tool Layer

The logical tool layer of a transinstitutional health information system consists of the
application components of all involved institutional information systems.
7.3.1

Integration of Application Components

The challenge of data redundancy is reinforced in a network of institutions. In different insti-
tutional types, such as rehabilitation centers, ambulatory care providers or private practices,
#7.3 Logical Tool Layer 189

different “best-of-breed” solutions have been used in the past and lots of vendors can be

found in the markets. Hence, all transinstitutional HIS do have (DB", AC", V") architectures.

Standards for integration, such as HL7, DICOM, and EDIFACT (see Sect. 6.5.4),
become even more important against this background. Integration needs communication
links between the respective application components. Of course the standards introduced
in Sect. 6.5.4 and the integration technologies of Sect. 6.5.5 can be applied for transinsti-
tutional HIS as well.

Especially important in this context is the IHE Technical Framework (see Sect. 6.5.4.6).
The THE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS) Integration Profile focuses on pro-
viding standard-based specifications for transinstitutional sharing of medical documents.
The content of the documents is not limited to textual information but also comprises
images and coded clinical information. In THE XDS, a document repository is responsible
for storing the documents in a secure, reliable and consistent way and responds to retrieval
requests that can be submitted by any connected institution. In the document registry,
information about these documents is stored so that they can be found and selected irre-
spective of the repositories where they are physically stored. The idea of the THE Patient
Demographics Query (PDG) Integration Profile is to implement a central patient informa-
tion server that is queried by other application components and retrieves the patient’s
demographic and visit information. The query can be based on the partial or complete
patient name, a patient ID, date of birth, age range, or bed ID.

In many areas standardization initiatives are either at the beginning or heavily influenced

by local governance. Hence, standards are not always scalable to an international scale.

Additionally, the following two problems are reinforced in transinstitutional information

systems:

e Encryption: Those messages transferred during communication in the context of noti-
fications, teleconsultations, or teleconferences, and for the global use of patient records,
have to be protected from unauthorized third party access. Encryption procedures
based on public key infrastructures exist for these cases. They are sufficiently secure
and can be obtained as commercial encryption software. A problem in this case, how-
ever, is the correct identification of the respective communication partner. A remedy in
this case could be electronic identification. In health care, the so-called health care
professional card (HPC) is currently being tried out, which uniquely identifies a spe-
cific health care professional. In Germany, a so-called Telematic Infrastructure is cur-
rently under construction, which combines such HPC with smart cards for patients,
called electronic health cards. Both elements shall enable secure data interchange in
health care.

e Patient identification: We have already determined that patient-based communication
within a hospital is only possible when a patient is identified uniquely by his or her PIN.
The proper assignment of a PIN to patients within a transinstitutional health informa-
tion system is only possible if there is only one application component used for admis-
sion in the health care network or if all application components that are used for
admission have access to one central master patient index (MPI). In case of MPI,
manually or semiautomatically found relationships of PINs from different institutions
are saved in one network MPI and are made available to all member institutions. IHE
PDG may be used to query the MPI.
#190 7 Specific Aspects for Architectures of Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

e This difficult process of patient identification is a huge barrier for the establishment of
a regional or even national patient health record. As an interim solution for notifica-
tions, teleconsultations, and teleconferences, patient identification can also be achieved
through the personal agreement of the involved parties.

In transinstitutional information systems, communication links between application com-
ponents in different organizations are means for providing access to distributed patient data.
Beside this, communication also enables the direct usage of a hospital’s application compo-
nent at a remote site. The use of portals, as discussed in Sect. 6.5.5.3, enables a physician at
his own practice to easily and cost-effectively read and update medical data in an electronic
patient record of a hospital. For example, this record may include the images that are man-
aged in the hospital’s radiology department. But note that this (simple) way of access inte-
gration will expect doctors to use different portals for every hospital they are in contact
with. This might reduce acceptance in a network of positively collaborating institutions.

Since institutions used to work as a “closed world” from patient admission to discharge
and transfer (see Sect. 6.3.1) many functions are carried out redundantly in transinstitu-
tional health information systems leading to functional redundancy (see Sects. 5.3.2.4,
8.5.4, 8.7.4). Well-organized patient identification and encrypted communication may
open potential for sharing application components and to give up components turning out
to be redundant in the context of the transinstitutional health information system. Two
hospitals in a network may, for example, share one patient administration system or RIS or
PACS instead of operating one at each site.

Unfortunately, computer-based application components supporting transinstitutional
data exchange are still exceptional. This poor transinstitutional integration results in the
challenge of transcription because the documents have to be printed out, sent by mail, and
retyped or scanned.

Electronic documents must contain structured information in order to be processed
automatically. Often, the semantics differ between institutions which results in the chal-
lenge of terminology and thus leading to the need for semantic integration. This challenge
is picked up by the openEHR initiative’. OpenEHR defines onotologies and provides open
source software tools for maintaining and managing patient-centric electronic health
records (compare Sect. 7.3.2.2). It contains clinical models of content and processes, which
are known as archetypes.

73.2
Strategies for Electronic Health Record Systems

Besides the intensified integrational challenges transinstitutional information systems have
to cope with specific problems regarding the ownership and organization of the electronic
health record (EHR). As discussed above transinstitutional health information systems are
characterized by (DB", AC", V") architectures and thus are very heterogeneous and highly

'http://www.openehr.org
#7.3 Logical Tool Layer 191

redundant. One important question is how an EHR can be organized in a way that the
complete set of relevant patient data is available whenever and wherever it is needed. To
achieve this goal the responsibility for completeness and availability could be assigned to
one actor in the health care system. In the following section, different strategies? of transin-
stitutional health information systems are discussed that are distinguished by the respon-
sible role. Note, that the introduced strategies may appear combined in reality.

73.21
The Provider-Centric Strategy

In the provider-centric strategy the medical records are kept by the institution that created
them and are made available to other organizations on request. This model supports a
process-oriented health care approach, which is central to such organizational types as man-
aged care, integrated delivery systems, and disease management programs. However, this
model has also some disadvantages. First, the information about a patient remains dispersed
between different institutions. The EHR can only be assembled virtually and is likely to be
incomplete, for example, if one institution that holds information about a patient is not avail-
able. Second, the participating institutions have to agree on semantic standards in order to
achieve semantic integration (see Sect. 6.5.3.2). Since semantics is often heavily influenced
by historically grown and institution-specific documentation processes, transinstitutional
alignment of semantics causes huge efforts. Third, the provider-centric strategy does not
neutralize the challenge of competition between the institutions on the one hand and the
need to cooperate in order to establish a complete EHR on the other hand (see Sect. 10).

73.2.2
The Patient-Centric Strategy

A second strategy that is implemented today is the patient-centric strategy. In this strategy,
the patient is perceived as the primary owner of his data. A patient can set up a record on
an internet portal or on other appropriate media. The record is filled by the patient and
practitioners or other physicians may support him or her. The patient decides which infor-
mation should be included and which persons can access the record. This type of patient-
owned electronic record is also called Personal Health Record (PHR). The disadvantages
of this model are the supposed incompleteness of the record, the perception of the record
by health workers as “unprofessional,” as well as the unsolved problem of accessing data
in emergency situations. In order to compensate for these disadvantages, the patient-centric
strategy is often combined with the provider-centric strategy, that is, a health care provider
manages the PHR on behalf of the patient.

The presented strategies of EHRs are based on: Shabo A. A Global Socio-economic-medico-legal
Model for the Sustainability of Longitudinal Electronic Health Records. Partl: Methods of
Information in Medicine 45(3):240-245. Part 2: Methods of Information in Medicine 2006;45(5):
498-505.
#192 7 Specific Aspects for Architectures of Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

73.2.3
The Regional- or National-Centric Strategy

In the so-called regional- or national-centric strategy, the EHR is maintained centrally by
a public institution. This can be on a regional or nationwide level. Although this strategy
has some advantages that are based on the legal authority of public services, the central-
ized operation might lead to inefficiency. Second, many ethical questions regarding the
problem of “Orwellization” remain unsolved.

73.24
The Strategy of Independent Health Banks

Finally, the non-centric strategy of “independent health banks” can be identified, although
this model has not been implemented yet. This strategy stands out, because it is not cen-
tered on the mentioned stakeholders in health care. Comparable to normal banks, there are
lots of independent health banks being responsible for managing lifetime EHRs without
having any control over other parties. Since these banks are not part of the health care
system, they remain neutral. In health care institutions, there would be no need to maintain
archives of medical records. This is similar to taking money to the most trusted bank
instead of keeping it in one’s own safe. This bank will also take care, that only authorized
parties will get (part of) the money.Physical Tool Layer

At the physical tool layer a transinstitutional health information system depends on a trust-
worthy and secure communication network. Installing and operating dedicated hardware
and, especially, exclusively used wires, cables, or radio-relay links to connect institutions
of a health care network could provide excellent potential for high performance and pro-
tection from illegal intrusion. But since these are quite expensive solutions, usually the
public infrastructure of the Internet is used.

Providing trustworthiness and security while using Internet-based communication
networks demands particular endeavors. An exclusively used communication network
can be simulated by virtual private networks (VPN), which are based on encryption tech-
nologies. But in most cases communication is needed not only to partners being con-
nected by the VPN but also to others. Therefore, institutions have to install so-called
firewall hardware to monitor and check data exchange between inside and outside the
institution’s information system. Thus an internal intranet is built, which is clearly sepa-
rated from the Internet. Servers hosting data, which shall be easily accessed by other
institutions and do not represent sensitive information, can be placed outside the intranet;
thus they form a so-called demilitarized zone. Obviously installation and operation of
such technologies require considerable technical know-how. In case of small institutions,
#7.5 Examples 193

for example, medical practices, particular support is needed. If in doubt it may be neces-
sary to disconnect computers connected to the Internet physically from those storing
sensitive data.Examples

75.1
“Gesundheitsnetz Tirol (GNT)”: The Tyrolean Health Care Network

7.5.11
Background and Overall Functionality

The state of Tyrol is located in the western part of Austria, with an alpine topography.
Twelve hospitals all over the state including the University Hospital of Innsbruck and
about 1,500 general practitioners or outpatient units provide medical care for about 700,000
citizens. In 2008, the “Gesundheitsnetz Tirol (GNT)” (Tyrolean Health Care Network)
project — was started, driven by the eHealth Action Plan of the European Union? and the
Austrian e-Health Initiative.*

Basically, the GNT network allows health care institutions (and later also patients) to
share documents (such as discharge summaries, nursing summaries, laboratory findings,
radiologic findings) as well as radiological images. The document formats conform to the
CDA Level 1 standard (XML with structured header information and with an embedded
PDF/A document). Participating organizations and professionals can make documents
available within the GNT. Other organizations and professionals can search for documents
or images and retrieve them. All available documents and images are indexed in a dedi-
cated application component, called registry which is using standardized metadata (e.g.,
metadata describing author and type of document).

75.1.2
System Architecture and Workflows

The GNT network is basically an [HE XDS Affinity Domain,’ meaning that each hospital
keeps its own document or image repository (provider-centric strategy). The distributed,
local application components are linked together by the following set of central application
components, allowing the localization and the access of the distributed data:

® The master patient index (conform to the IHE PDQ integration profiles)

® The XDS document registry (conform to the THE XDS integration profile)

® An audit record repository (for logging every transaction in this network)
® A gateway for communication with other IHE XDS Affinity Domains in Austria

The software products are designed as modular components using web service technology.

The product family is called “sense® — smart eHealth solutions.” Figure 7.2 shows an

illustration of the architecture.

To make a document or image (e.g., based on DICOM) available within the GNT, the

document is automatically submitted from the clinical information system of a participat-

ing organization (called “document source”) to the Source Adaptor which triggers the

following THE Transactions (see Fig. 7.2, dark-gray numbers):

1. Adding patient identification to the master patient index (PIX/PDQ) (using several
identification characteristics and sophisticated matching algorithms)

2. Submitting the document to the own institutional application component, where the
document will be stored (XDS document repository)

3. Submitting metadata to the XDS document registry (to allow later search and retrieval
of the document)

3. Retrieving the document from one of the local XDS document repositories

Sharing of patient data requires a sophisticated security concept reaching from authenti-
cated and encrypted data exchange to an advanced authorization framework, which —
in future — should empower the patient to decide who may access his/her health
information.

7513
Important Lessons Learned

Prior and during the implementation, a couple of important lessons have been learned,

which are of interest to other similar projects:

e The financing and initiation of projects related to eHealth is one of the most difficult
tasks. The benefits are mostly realized for public economics, but less for business eco-
nomics. Consequently, health care institutions are often not willing to invest in such
solutions. In addition, health care professionals do not care primarily for overall sav-
ings, but try to identify benefits for their personal work. However, these personal
benefits of eHealth infrastructures or applications for the individual professional are
difficult to be verified. Therefore it is difficult to create acceptance amongst health
professionals.

e At the beginning, several independent Tyrolean health care organizations jointly
requested a standardized eHealth infrastructure to improve their cooperation. This was
the start of the Tyrolean eHealth initiatives. A Tyrolean working group (“ARGE GNT”)
for common coordination, consisting of all participating health care institutions (CEOs/
CIOs of hospitals), was established in 2008, and has successfully served as moderator
and initiator of eHealth projects since then.

e The introduction of standards for medical document formats and for metadata was one
of the most labor intensive steps. With currently available technology such as the
Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), a very fine-grained structure can be applied
to clinical data. Structuring of clinical data influences the workflow of data capturing.
This is an organizational rather than a technical challenge, as health professionals
must be motivated to switch from flexible free text to a rigid framework for data
capturing.

e Austrian data protection regulations require a 2-level access control mechanism. The first
level requires that a current treatment relationship exists between physician and patient.
This is verified by the so-called e-card (the Austrian health insurance card) that is needed
to access data in the GNT. The second level requires that the patient gives his/her explicit
consent to document retrieval from the GNT. In the consent document, the patient can
restrict access for institutions, departments, document type, and time range (e.g., just
allowing the health care professional to search for laboratory findings). At the moment,
level 2 restrictions are not supported technically, instead physicians querying for docu-
ments have to follow the patient’s restrictions when setting search criteria in the GNT
#196 7 Specific Aspects for Architectures of Transinstitutional Health Information Systems

user interface. In order to assure that these restrictions are actually applied, all queries are
logged, and health care professionals have to agree to periodic inspections of consent
documents to prove that their GNT queries match the written consent of the patient.

o Early usability evaluation revealed that a seamless integration of the GNT application in the
clinical information system or the GP system is vital for end-user acceptance. A web portal
solution is only the second-best choice due to limited data integration and to transcription.

® Operating the GNT in a dedicated physical network, strictly separated from the Internet,
improves security, and, therewith, also end-user acceptance.

7.5.2
Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)

The VISTA system from the Department of Veterans Affairs, USA (VA) is likely one of
the largest transinstitutional health information systems in the world. Its advantage has
been nicely demonstrated a few years ago when New Orleans experienced the Kathrina
disaster and many people got displaced. The VA system was the only that was able to care
for their patients and had all information available at other places.

Since 1999, the VA's 155 hospitals, 881 clinics, 135 nursing homes, and 45 rehabilita-
tion centers in the USA have been linked by a so-called universal medical records network.
It allows any authorized person to look at 5.3 million patients’ records — everything from
a nurse’s note written during a hospital stay, to the result of a blood test drawn at a clinic
visit, to the moving-picture film of a coronary angiogram done in a cardiology lab.

VISTA is built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and per-
sonal computers with graphical user interfaces at Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
facilities, as well as software developed by local medical facility staff. VISTA also includes
the links that allow commercial off-the-shelf software and products to be used with existing
and future technologies. VISTA uses standard coding for much of its data, including ICD-9
and LOINC, and other universal and standards-based coding methodologies.The Hypergenes Biomedical Information Infrastructure®

Health information systems as discussed so far are primarily supporting patient care. But
the care related data they store are also needed for clinical research. Related research proj-
ects such as clinical trials are often organized multicentric, that is, taking patient data out
of many health care institutions into account. Hence, we again come to transinstitutional
information systems.

For research purposes the semantic meaning of gathered data has to be known exactly.
But, unfortunately, institutional HIS typically contain data and knowledge related to a

specific health domain with idiosyncratic semantics. As such they constitute silos of infor-
mation and data as well as semantic integration are hard to achieve. Data warehouses (see
Sect. 6.4.12) are established in an attempt to accomplish such integration and support
patient-centric care as well as secondary use of the data such as analysis of aggregated data
in the context of clinical research, quality assurance, operational systems optimization,
patient safety, and public health. In health care, the emerging concept of personalized care
involves taking into account the clinical, environmental, and genetic makeup of the indi-
vidual. To that end, a data warehouse may serve as a main information source for putting
together data of patient electronic health records (EHR) in a health care network where
consistent and explicit semantics is crucial for machines to reason about the records.

The IBM Haifa Research Lab (HRL) developed a Biomedical Information Infrastructure
(BII) as a transinstitutional HIS aiming at the integration of data from the various data sets
owned by the partners of the Hypergenes network. The main goal of the Hypergenes proj-
ect is to integrate the clinical, environmental, and genomics data in order to develop a
comprehensive disease model for the essential hypertension chronic disease.

One of the main challenges of data warehousing within biomedical information sys-
tems is to achieve semantic integration between its various stakeholders as well as other
interested parties. Promoting the adoption of worldwide accepted information standards
along with common terminologies is the right path to achieve that. To that end, the HL7
Reference Information Model (RIM) has been used as the underlying model for semantic
warehousing aimed at establishing integrity and consistency across a vast and growing
number of health domains such as laboratory, clinical health record data, problem- and
goal-oriented care, public health, and clinical research. The RIM-based data warehouse
provides (1) the means for integration of data and knowledge gathered from disparate and
diverse data sources, (2) a mixture of XML and relational schemas, and (3) a uniform
abstract access and query capability serving both health care and clinical research users.

Through the use of templates, which are sets of constraints on RIM-based standards,
semantic integration was facilitated which would be harder to achieve if only generic stan-
dards in use cases with unique requirements would have been used. The semantic data
warehousing facilitates the continuum of knowledge, information, and data to enable an
infrastructure for analysis tools, decision support application components, clinical data
exchange, and clinical application components.The National Health Information System in Korea™

The Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) has been implementing the National
health information system (NHIS) as a computer-supported transinstitutional HIS with
focus on public health centers since 1995. Unlike other Asian and European countries,
public health sector is much weaker than the private health sector. Only 11% of health
institutions belong to the public sector. MOHW has introduced NHIS in 1995 based on the

client-server architecture. As a result, all public health institutions (250 health centers,
1,200 health subcenters, and 2,000 health posts) have been implementing institutional
computer-based HIS since then.

‘While the computer-based HIS have helped to reduce workloads of health workers by
reducing paper works and improved accuracy and timeliness of health statistics at health
centers, there were problems with maintenance of hardware and software for the health
centers located in the remote areas and with information sharing among health centers and
MOHW. Accordingly, MOHW has decided to convert the client-server based systems in
2005 to the web-based ASP (Application Service Provider) system which means that one
central server covers the entire health institutions by its services (compare Sect. 6.5.5.3).
In addition, MOHW developed the National Standards for health information and
Electronic Health Record (EHR) for community residents.

Hospitals use NHIS to send EHR extracts to health centers for a follow-up care of the
discharged patients. And health centers and hospitals also use NHIS to refer their patients
to other hospitals. Such information sharing helps reducing duplicate tests and improves
continuous care for patients.

‘When community residents register their information to EHR at a hospital or health cen-
ter, hospital or health center staffs use it to refer him or her to other health institutions, to
provide public health services (e.g., tuberculosis program, health screen, etc.), and to process
insurance claims. NHIS is also used by the National Health Insurance Corporation for insur-
ance claim review and by other health institutes for producing various health statistics on
cancer, tuberculosis, infectious diseases, etc. Once health center staff has completed the
monthly reports on activities, they are sent to MOHW via NHIS for review and decision
making. Systems analysts at the National Health Information Center use them for analyzing
overall operation, updating EHR, and validating it for consistency with standards and code.Exercises

a different term as introduced in this book in order to harmonize these examples?

7.6.4
Transinstitutional Information Systems in other Sectors

In which sectors outside of health care can transinstitutional information systems be found?
‘Where do they play a vital role?Summary

Since medical treatment often involves many different actors over a long period of time,
relevant medical data should be available regardless to the institution where they have
been produced.

Transinstitutional information systems feature all enterprise functions to be performed
in the member institutions of the respective health care network.

At the domain layer, a unique patient and a case identifier are needed to support the
function patient admission. These identifiers have to be valid and available throughout the
whole health care network. Decision making, planning, and organization of patient treat-
ment can be improved by including experts from different institutions. By sharing resources,
such as radiological equipment, health care can be organized more efficiently.

The logical tool layer of a transinstitutional health information system consists of the
application components of all involved institutional information systems. The challenges
for integration are even more complex in comparison to institutional information systems.
Additionally, the problems of encryption and patient identification are reinforced.

Different strategies for organizing transinstitutional EHRs can be identified, which may
appear in combination. In the provider-centric strategy, the medical records are kept by the
institution that created them and are made available to other organizations on request. In
the patient-centric strategy, the patient is in authority of his data and controls the content
of and access to his record. In the regional- or national-centric strategy, the EHR is main-
tained by public services. The strategy of independent health banks is characterized by
neutral actors that are responsible for managing the EHR, while not being part of the actual
health care system.

At the physical tool layer a transinstitutional health information system depends on a
trustworthy and secure communication network.
##Quality of Health Information SystemsIntroduction

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines quality in general as the
ability to meet all the expectations of the purchaser of goods or services, or in other words,
as the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements, where “require-
ments” means need or expectation. Three major approaches to quality assessment are typi-
cally distinguished: Quality of structures, quality of processes, and quality of outcome. In
the context of health care, the concept of quality of structures applies to the human, physi-
cal, and financial resources that are needed to provide medical care (e.g., educational level
of staff, availability of medical equipment). Quality of processes describes the quality of
activities carried out by care providers (e.g., adherence to professional standards, appropri-
ateness of care). Finally, quality of outcome describes the effects of patient care, that is, the
changes in the health status of the patient (e.g., mortality, morbidity, costs). While quality
of structures influences quality of processes, quality of processes in turn influences quality
of outcome.

Those concepts can be transferred to health information systems. In this context, quality
of structures refers to the availability of technical or human resources needed for informa-
tion processing (e.g., number and availability of computer systems and other ICT, i.e., the
HIS infrastructure). Quality of processes deals with the quality of the information pro-
cesses that are necessary to meet the user’s needs. Quality of outcome describes whether
the goals of information management have been reached, or, in a broader sense, to what
extent, for example, a hospital information system contributes to the goals of the
hospital.

These quality concepts for health information systems can help to identify and solve
problems concerning information processing. In other words, quality characteristics may
help to describe HIS “diseases” (the problems), the corresponding HIS “diagnoses” (iden-
tification of the problems), and adequate HIS “therapies” (solution of the problems).

It may not be so difficult to describe what a bad health information system means. But
what are the characteristics and features of a good health information system? In this chap-
ter, we introduce some of the most essential ones.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

eo Which facets of quality have to be considered in HIS?

‘What are the characteristics of the quality of structures of HIS?

‘What are the characteristics of the quality of processes of HIS?

‘What are the characteristics of quality of outcome of HIS?

‘What does information management have to balance in order to increase the quality
of a HIS?

e How can quality of HIS be evaluated?Quality of Structures

In the context of health information systems, the quality of structures refers to the technical

or human resources needed for information processing. With respect to the technical

resources it comprises quality characteristics of data, quality of computer-based application

components, quality of physical data processing systems, and quality of architectures.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

® What criteria for quality of data exist?

® What criteria for computer-based application components and physical data processing
systems exist?

® What criteria for the overall HIS architecture exist?

8.2.1
Quality of Data

Data that are stored and processed in a health information system should adhere to certain

criteria for quality of data, such as

e Integrity (see Sect. 6.5.2): Comprises the mere correctness (e.g., correct diagnosis),
object identity (e.g., correct identification of every patient by a unique patient identifi-
cation number), referential integrity (e.g., each clinical report can uniquely be linked to
a patient), and consistency of redundant data (e.g., the name of a patient is not spelled
differently in different databases).

e Reliability: Data are reliable when they are verifiable. For example, there is no element
of uncertainty with regard to the clinical findings because they are signed by a respon-
sible doctor.

e Completeness: Describes whether data are sufficiently complete for a given purpose.
For example, administrative data on a patient should be complete to allow patient
identification.

® Accuracy: Describes that data should be free from mistakes. For example, patient labo-
ratory findings are free of measurement or transcription errors.

e Relevancy: Degree to which data are of relevance for a given situation. For example, no
irrelevant data such as “number of grandchildren’s friends” are stored.
#8.2 Quality of Structures 203

Standardization: Data are uniformly recorded and there are clear rules on what data and
how the data are recorded and stored. For example, the “nutritional status” shall be
recorded for all inpatients using the value set {cachectic, thin, normal weight, over-
weight, adipose, others}. A high degree of standardization leads to well-structured data
and thus fosters their processability (e.g., specific items from lab results can be extracted
and processed to produce a 1-week overview of one parameter) whereas low standard-
ization (e.g., when recording data simply as narrative texts) leads to unstructured and
hardly processible data. To support standardization, coding systems such as ICD-10 or
LOINC may be used.

Authenticity: Describes that data have an established authorship. For example, the
authorship of a discharge report is clear and indisputable.

Availability: Describes the degree of availability of data. For example, recent lab results
are available at the patient’s bedside.

Confidentiality and security: Clinical data should be kept confidential. For example, the
diagnoses of a patient are only accessible by the treating health care professionals.

8.2.2
Quality of Computer-Based Application Components and Their Integration

ISO 25000" provides six quality characteristics for software, which can be applied to com-
puter-based application components:

Functionality: Does an application component have the required functionality? For
example, a RIS contains functionality required for report writing, it provides correct
output when searching for a patient, and it guarantees security of stored data.
Reliability: Can an application component provide defined services for a defined time
under certain conditions? For example, a RIS has no down-times and is tolerant with
regard to wrong data entry by a user.

Efficiency: How much resources are needed for an application component? For exam-
ple, a RIS has a good response rate of less than 1 s for most of the functionalities.
Maintainability: How much effort does it take to modify an application component? For
example, an upgrade of the RIS software can be done quickly and without endangering
overall application component’s stability.

Portability: How easily can a software product be transferred to another environment?
For example, a RIS software follows established market standards with regard to the
used database systems and operating systems.

Usability: Is the application component easy to use? For more details on software ergo-
nomics, see next paragraph.

tion — Quality characteristics and guidelines for their use. Geneva: International Organization for
Standardization, International Electrotechnical Commission; 2005. http:/www.iso.org
#204 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

Good usability is very important for software used within health care institutions. Health

care professionals spend only a smaller amount of their working time at computers and

they often have to use various application components for their work. In addition, staff

turnover is very high. Therefore, software products should be easy to learn and to use intui-

tively. This is addressed by ISO 92412, which defines specific quality characteristics for

software ergonomics. Part 9241-110 of this standard deals with dialogue principles for

user interface design:

e Suitability for the task: Does the user interface support the user in fulfilling her or his
tasks effectively and efficiently?

e Suitability for learning: Is the user supported to learn and use the user interface?

e Suitability for individualization: Can the user interface be adapted to the tasks and to
the individual skills and needs of the user?

e Conformity with user expectations: Is the user interface consistent and adapted to the
characteristics of the user (e.g., his knowledge, skills, and expectations)?

o Self-descriptiveness: Is each step of the user interface understandable for the user by
providing direct feedback or explanation?

e Controllability: Can the user, after having initiated the first step, control the flow and
speed of tasks?

e Error tolerance: Can the task be completed if obviously wrong input is entered by the
user, with either little or no effort to correct it?

There exist further quality criteria for software products that are of relevance for health

care:

e Adaptability: Can a software product be easily adapted to the working context? For
example, functionality of a RIS software can be adapted to the particular workflow in a
specific radiology.

® Availability: Is the application component made available at all places where it is
needed? This means: Is access integration guaranteed (see Sect. 6.5.3.3)? For example,
is the RIS available in all treatment rooms of the outpatient unit?

e Sustainability: How sustainable is the overall software product? For example, a RIS
software is still built on the programming language that is not further supported and
developed.

® Maturity: Is the software product free of errors? For example, a RIS runs after installa-
tion immediately and durably without relevant errors.

o Certification: Is the software product certified? For example, the PACS software is certi-
fied according to the national law for medical devices.

e Standardized interfaces: Whether software products support different standards for
integration (such as HL7) as introduced in Sect. 6.5.4 is another important aspect of

display terminals (VDTs). Geneva: International Organization for Standardization, International

#8.2 Quality of Structures 205

quality of structures. Otherwise integration in AC" architectures is hardly reachable in
an economically reasonable way.

Since health care professionals are usually confronted with more than one application
component and thus with a multiplicity of software products, presentation integration (see
Sect. 6.5.3.4) should be guaranteed as well.

A high quality of structures at the logical tool layer of a HIS is achieved, if data, seman-
tic, access, presentation, and functional integration hold as described in Sect. 6.5.3.
Contextual and process integration are part of quality of processes (see Sect. 8.3).

8.2.3
Quality of Physical Data Processing Systems

The quality of physical data processing systems can be described by the following major

characteristics:

® Availability: For example, computers are available both in the ward office and at the
patient’s bedside.

® Appropriateness: For example, the bedside computer does not dominate the physician-
patient relationship.

e Mobility: For example, mobile tools like PDA and tablet-PC, which are not restricted
to a certain working place, are available.

® Multiple usability: For example, a personal computer or a mobile tool can be used for
more than one task.

e Flexibility: For example, the mobile tools used on a ward can be updated with new
memory easily.

e Maintainability: For example, costs for purchase and support of tools are low.

e Stability and reliability: For example, a server has no down-times.

® Security: For example, the mobile tools support data safety and data security as well as elec-
trical safety. There exist standards such as ISO270013 that focus on these safety aspects.

e Harmlessness: For example, a computer in the operating room is designed not to harm
the patient or the clinical user by electric hazards.

e Usability: For example, a mobile tool allows easy data entry by a touch screen.

e Standardization: For example, all computer-based physical tools follow predefined
standards for technical interfaces (see Sect. 6.7.2 for details).

e Performance: For example, the network bandwidth allows quick data transmission.

e Up-to-dateness: For example, all client computers used are not older than 3 years.

® Certification: For example, the tools used in the intensive care unit are certified accord-
ing to the national law for medical devices.

#206 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

8.24
Quality of the Overall HIS Architecture

HIS architecture should ensure that the different computer-based and non-computer-based
information processing tools can be smoothly and efficiently integrated, in order to pro-
vide a maximum quality of information processing.

There are some general characteristics that can be used to describe structural quality of

a HIS architecture:

e Transparency: The details of the HIS architecture are described in an up-to-date docu-
mentation {e.g., using 3LGM" as modeling language).

e Adaptability: In general, the hospital information system should be sufficiently flexible
to adapt to the changing needs of the hospital. For example, it should be easy to add new
computer-based application components to the information system, and application
components should be easily replaceable by other (more advanced) application compo-
nents. A star-based architecture (CP! architecture) with a communication server (see
Sect. 6.5.1.3) supports exchanging or adding of new computer-based application com-
ponents. Additionally, the available bandwidth of the network infrastructure should be
easily extendable to match increasing volume of communication.

e Saturation: An architecture is saturated if as many enterprise functions as possible are
supported by computer-based tools, and if there are no or only a small number of non-
computer-based tools still in use.

® Functional leanness: As described in detail in Sects. 5.3.2.4 and 8.7.4, functional redundancy
is an indication for superfluous application components. The opposite, functional leanness
(see Sect. 8.5.4), assures that each function is only supported by one application component.

e Controlled redundancy of data: Usually, redundant data storage should be avoided at
the logical tool layer. As has been discussed in Sect. 6.5.1.1 (AC", V") architectures, that
is, “best-of-breed” architectures are quite common for HIS. And since (AC", V") archi-
tectures are always of DB" style, data redundancy is nearly unavoidable in these archi-
tectures. Good architectural quality can only be achieved if all measures are taken to
provide consistency of redundant data (see Sect. 6.5.2.3). However, at the physical tool
layer, data redundancy is often valuable. For example, data may be stored redundantly
in different sites in order to avoid data loss in case of systems failures. Or patient data
may be available in the electronic patient record, but also as copy in a microfiche
archive or in a paper archive. Also, data may be duplicated on different hard discs in a
specific database server (e.g., using redundant array of independent discs [RAID] tech-
nology), allowing reconstruction of data when a hard disc fails.

8.2.6
Summary

Criteria for quality of structures of health information systems comprise quality of data,

quality of computer-based application components, quality of physical data processing

systems, and quality of HIS architecture.

® Quality of data comprises issues such as referential integrity, correctness, integrity, reli-
ability, completeness, accuracy, relevance, processability, authenticity, standardization,
availability, confidentiality, security, and safety.

® Quality of computer-based application components is based on aspects of software
quality (such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, portability, adapt-
ability, sustainability, scalability, maturity, and certification) and software ergo-
nomics (such as suitability, conformity, self-descriptiveness, controllability, and
error tolerance).

® Quality of physical data processing systems comprises availability, appropriateness,
mobility, multiple usability, flexibility, maintainability, stability, security, harmlessness,
usability, standardization, performance, up-to-dateness, and certification.

® Quality of architecture comprises transparency, adaptability, saturation, functional
leanness, and controlled data redundancy.
#208 8 Quality of Health Information SystemsQuality of Processes

In medicine, quality of processes describes the quality of activities carried out by care
providers (e.g., adherence to professional standards, appropriateness of care). In the con-
text of health information systems, quality of processes deals with the quality of the infor-
mation processes that are necessary to meet the user’s needs. An information process is a
sequence of enterprise functions (see Sect. 5.3.2.1).

Criteria for quality of information processes in HIS comprise single recording and multiple
usability of data, controlled transcription of data, leanness of information processing tools,
efficiency of information logistics, and patient-centered information processing. All those
quality criteria support good process integration, that is, that business processes (see Sect. 3.3.3)
are effectively supported by a set of interacting application components (see Sect. 6.5.3.7).
After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following question:
® What are the characteristics of the quality of processes of HIS?

8.3.1
Single Recording, Multiple Usability of Data

Application components often need the same data. For example, patient administrative
data or basic medical data are needed by RIS and LIS. To avoid duplicate data entry, which
is inefficient and prone to error, data should be recorded only once, even when they are
stored in different databases. One prerequisite is data integration (see Sect. 6.5.3.1).
Multiple usability of data is one of the most important benefits computer support can bring
to information systems.

8.3.2
No Transcription of Data

Transcription means the manual transfer of data from one storage device to another storage
device, for example, to transfer patient diagnoses from the patient record to an order entry
form, or to copy data from a printout into a computer-based application component
(Figs. 8.1 and 8.2). Transcription is often combined with a change of the storage media
(media crack), for example, transcribing data from a computer-based media to paper (or
other way round). Manual transcription is time-consuming and may lead to copy-errors.
Therefore, manual transcription has to be avoided.

8.3.3
Leanness of Information Processing Tools

Even if process integration (see Sect. 6.5.3.7) is achieved, the user wants to use as few
application components and data processing systems as possible for a given process. Thus
#8.3 Quality of Processes
Fig.8.1 Example of a transcription (1)

Fig.8.2 Example of a transcription (2)
#210 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

for each process, there should be all the tools necessary but as few as possible. For exam-
ple, let us look at the execution of nursing procedures. Maybe a nurse has to use the nurs-
ing management and documentation system, the patient administration system, and the
paper-based order entry system. The fewer information processing tools have to be used
for one process, the easier it is for the staff. In case different tools have to be used, contex-
tual integration (see Sect. 6.5.3.5) can help to reduce the efforts for the user when he has
to change between the tools.

8.34
Efficiency of Information Logistics

Information processing should be as efficient as possible. This means that information
logistics should be as good as possible given the used resources. Good information logistics
comprises the following aspects:

e The right information: Is the information, that the users need, available? For example,
is the recent lab result available for the physician?

e At the right time: Is the information available when it is needed (just in time)? For
example, are the recent lab results available before the physician’s round starts?

e At the right place: Is the information available where it is needed? For example, are the
recent lab results available at the patient’s bedside?

e To the right people: Is the information available only to those needing it? For example,
are the recent lab results only available to the treating health care professionals? Is data
protection guaranteed?

® In the right form: Is the information available in a usable format? For example, can lab
results also be displayed over a longer period of time? Can information personally be
filtered (personal filtering), not overwhelming the health care professional with too
much information (information overload)?

8.3.5
Patient-Centered Information Processing

Since patient care is highly specialized and distributed, it creates great demand for inte-
grated information processing among health care professionals and among health care
institutions (see Sect. 4.3). Information processing, therefore, should center on the patient
(not on the institution). This means, for example, that all relevant data about a patient,
regardless of what institution produced the data, should be made available to any health
care professional in any institution involved in the care of the patient. The availability of
an electronic health record system that stores all data about a patient is usually the precon-
dition for real patient-centered information processing.

In medicine, quality of outcome describes the effects of patient care, that is, the changes in
the health status of the patient (e.g., mortality, morbidity, costs). In the context of health
information systems, quality of outcome describes whether the goals of information man-

agement have been reached, or, in a broader sense, to what extent the health information

system contributes to the goals of the respective institution and to the expectations of dif-

ferent stakeholders.

Quality of outcome thus means whether the health information system finally fulfills

the hospital information system contributes to the aims of the hospital or the expectations
of the stakeholders. Quality of structures and quality of processes is just a prerequisite for
quality of outcome.

After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following question:

e What are the characteristics of quality of outcome of HIS especially in hospitals?

8.4.1
Fulfillment of Hospital's Goals

For the hospital as an enterprise, the hospital information system should typically contrib-
ute to high quality patient care, efficient usage of resources, and fulfillment of legal require-
ments as general goals of all hospitals.

Additionally, each hospital may have specific goals as defined in an enterprise strategy,
such as

e support of clinical research;

e support of medical education;

e offering holistic, interprofessional, patient-oriented care;

o offering high-quality care for a special patient group (offering specialized medical
competence centers);

offering shared-care in close cooperation with certain health care providers;

attracting patients from other regions;

being very cost-effective; or

using up-to-date and expensive technology.

The hospital information system must contribute to the specific strategic goals of the hos-

pital (strategic alignment, see Sect. 9.4.1.1). For example, a HIS may support the hospital

goals by offering:

eo cfficient communication with other health care providers (e.g., quick communication
of discharge reports);

e a comprehensive electronic patient record that can be used by all departments and
health professionals in the institution;

e mobile tools for all professionals and bedside terminals, or, on the contrary, no IT tools

near the patient;

restricted access to electronic patient records for teaching purposes;

a personal health record offering patients access to “their” electronic health record;

data analysis functionality of electronic health record data for clinical research;

highly standardized, modern, and effective IT tools.

Fulfillment of the Expectations of Different Stakeholders

Distinct stakeholders have specific expectations. The following user needs should be

Patients want to be treated in a both emphatic and effective way, they want to recover
quickly, be released from pain, and be able to get home soon. They do not want to be
harmed during the diagnosis and treatment process by preventable medication errors. They
do not want to be interviewed or examined repeatedly on the same questions. Patients want
easy access to their patient record and clear explanations on their diseases. Parents want
quick information when the state of the treated child changes. Some parents may even
want to use telemonitoring facilities (e.g., via a webcam) to observe their kids at every
time (see example 8.7.3). Relatives want to easily find a person within the hospital build-
ing. During discharge, the patient wants to get a summary of this treatment, and clear
advice on what to do next. Overall, patients want that their data are handled in a secure and
safe way, ensuring confidentiality and avoiding misusage.

8.4.2.2
Health Care Professionals

Health care professionals want to be supported in their daily work by the IT tools. This
means, for example, that documentation tasks are supported by easy-to-use data entry
forms, and double documentation and transcription should be avoided. New patient infor-
mation should be available quickly at the place where the professional needs it (e.g., dur-
ing the ward round). The health professional does not want to lose time by searching for
data, or by dealing with complicated or instable software. Information of earlier stays
should be available in an aggregated, well-structured form, and communication with pro-
fessionals outside the hospital should be well supported. Health professionals want to be
able to reuse clinical data for other tasks such as clinical research, clinical education, and
administrative tasks (multiple usability). Medical knowledge should be accessible easily
wherever needed. IT tools should be user-friendly and robust and show sufficient perfor-
mance, and paper-based and computer-based tools should work hand-in-hand. If possible,
only one computer-based application component should be needed for one business pro-
cess, without any media crack in between.

8.4.2.3
Administrative Staff

For administrative staff, it is most important that up-to-date and complete administra-
tive information is available. They want automatic tools to guarantee and check the
correctness and completeness of administrative data, and automatic interfaces to trans-
fer relevant administrative data to health insurances and other types of organizations.
They also want to generate all relevant statistics and reports automatically from
available data.
#8.4 Quality of Outcome 215

8.4.24
Hospital Management

Hospital management needs easy access to complete and up-to-date information on the
quality of patient care and on its costs. For this, it needs access to all kind of quality and
performance data produced in the different parts of the hospital.

84.3
Fulfillment of Information Management Laws

In each country, different laws affect health information processing, addressing, for exam-
ple, organization of health care, financing of health care, and health statistics. Those laws
must be taken into account by information management.

An important part of these laws deals with data protection. Health-related patient
data are most sensitive and must be protected from unauthorized access. Normally,
only those health care professionals involved in the treatment of patients should be
able to access patient data, and only those data that are of potential importance for
optimal patient care should be stored. For example, for a surgical patient, earlier
psychiatric stays may not be relevant to the surgeon. The information system should
be designed in such a way that data protection (as defined by the national laws) is
guaranteed.

For example, in the USA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) deals with standards for electronic data interchange, protection of security and
confidentiality of electronic health information, and unique identifiers for providers and
patients.® In Germany, for example, laws on the organization of health care (SGB V°), on
its financing (KHG,” KHRG.? BPlV®), on data protection (BDSG'?), on digital signatures
(SigG,'" TuKDG'?), and on hospital statistics (KHStatV'?) have to be taken into account in
information management.

Exercises

8.4.4.1
Expectation of Patients and Relatives

Imagine the last time you (or one of your relatives) was patient in a health care institution.
List the aspects where you have been satisfied during your stay there, and which aspects
were not satisfactory. In which way does this list contain criteria related to health informa-
tion systems? Does your list correspond to the criteria discussed in Sect. 8.4.2.1?

84.4.2
National Laws for Information Processing

As described above, information processing has to take into account the different laws of
the respective country. Find out — for example, using information from the Internet, from
publications, or from other lectures — which laws are important for your country with
regard to information processing. Briefly describe the content of the laws.

8.4.5
Summary

The criteria for quality of outcome of health information systems are
e fulfillment of the hospital's goals;

o fulfillment of the expectations of different stakeholders;

o fulfillment of the information management laws.Balance as a Challenge for Information Management

Besides quality criteria, optimal balance is also a determinant of the quality of a health

information system. This is a particular challenge for information management, as it must

weigh the different — and possibly contradicting — goals of the hospital. The solution will

require the ability of those responsible for information management to carry through with

their goals, and the willingness of the affected stakeholders to compromise. Above all, an

appropriate organization of strategic information management is required (see Chap. 9).
After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following question:

® What does information management have to balance in order to increase the quality of
a health information system?
#8.5 Balance asa Challenge for Information Management 217

8.5.1
Balance of Homogeneity and Heterogeneity

The collection of information processing tools (both on the logical and on the physical tool
layer) should be as homogeneous (i.e., comparable in appearance and usability, for exam-
ple, using tools from the same vendor) as possible and as heterogeneous as necessary. In
general, a homogeneous set of information processing tools makes training and support of
users easier and thus leads to reduced costs for the HIS. However, in reality, we usually
find a very heterogeneous set of tools at both the logical and the physical tool layer.
Why?

In a hospital we need application components at the logical tool layer for the support of
the hospital functions. Maximum homogeneity, at least for the computer-supported part of
a hospital information system, can easily be reached by a (DB!, AC!, V') architecture,
when just one computer-based application component exists that is implemented through
a single software product from a single manufacturer. But usually diverse software prod-
ucts from different manufacturers have to be purchased, which can lead to very heteroge-
neous (DB", AC", V") architectures. These products might please the various stakeholders
of the hospital (which will all have optimal support for their own tasks), but they will make
integration, operation, and user support much more difficult. These difficulties are often
overlooked by the concerned stakeholders. In this situation, it is the task of information
management to ensure and support an appropriate compromise between the hospital's
need for economical homogeneous information processing and the needs of the various
stakeholders.

At the physical tool layer, heterogeneity is often the consequence of the evolution of the
HIS, comprising different generations of computer systems. This could be prevented only
if all components are completely exchanged regularly, which is generally not sensible.

Heterogeneity is not always bad. Moreover, heterogeneity is appropriate to a certain
degree. But when heterogeneity of information processing tools is not systematically man-
aged, it can lead to the uncontrolled proliferation of tools and to unnecessary costs. The
better all stakeholders are involved in strategic information management through an
appropriate organization, the more this situation can be avoided (see Sect. 9.3).

8.5.2
Balance of Computer-Based and Non-Computer-Based Tools

It is the task of information management to manage information processing in such a way
that the goals of the hospital can be reached best. So, for a hospital whose goal is to provide
very personal and humane treatment, it might be sensible, for example, to abstain from the
use of technology and especially computers for all immediate physician-patient contact. It
is possible to write notes on the ward with paper and pen (and even so-called digital pens)
rather than using electronic tools, depending on what best supports the hospital’s functions.
For a hospital whose goal is technological leadership, it might be appropriate to proceed in
the opposite direction (see Fig. 8.4).
#218 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

Fig.8.4 A stylish client at a patient admission unit

That is, the optimum of computer support is not defined by the maximum, rather, it
evolves through the various goals of the hospital and its stakeholders as well as through the
hospital functions to be supported.

8.5.3
Balance of Data Security and Working Processes

The data saved in a hospital information system are worth protecting. Every patient must
be confident that his or her data will not be made available to an unauthorized third party.
To ensure this, the appropriate laws of the particular country are to be adhered to. However,
hospital information systems are not just purely technical, but rather are socio-technical
systems. This means that people are also part of the information system and are therefore
also responsible for data security and protection.

A hospital information system should implement strict access control methods to ensure
that unauthorized access is impossible. However, this can lead to hindrances in the daily
work of the health care professionals. For example, it may occur that a medication cannot
be prescribed in an emergency when the attending physician belongs to another hospital
department and therefore does not have the right to read the lab result or to order a medica-
tion. This can, in an extreme case, even lead to a life-threatening situation. Thus, an access
control system that is strict and adapted to predefined tasks and roles in a department can
#8.5 Balance asa Challenge for Information Management 219

hinder the cooperation between health care professionals and other departments. This
would be unfortunate, as it is the job of information management to build the HIS such that
cooperation is supported. Consequently, following a thorough risk analysis, it should be
weighed whether access control measures in certain situations should be less strict for
medical staff, thereby strengthening their own level of responsibility.

Similar risks should be considered in determining how long data should be kept. Health
care laws, research needs, and lawsuit requirements should be addressed. So, for example,
following the expiration of the storage period, if documents are destroyed, it could be dif-
ficult to prove that the hospital carried out a correct medical process in the event of a
lawsuit. The resulting consequences would be requests for damage compensation and pos-
sibly punishment. However, long-term storage of data may be costly and space-consuming
(e.g., archive room, disk storage capacity). Risk management must be carried out with
strong support from hospital management.

8.5.4
Balance of Functional Leanness and Functional Redundancy

Functional leanness describes a situation where one hospital function is supported by one
and only one application component; the opposite is functional redundancy (see also
Sect. 8.7.4), which results in additional costs both for investment and maintenance. But as
discussed with controlled data redundancy (compare Sect. 8.2.4), functional redundancy is
not always bad. For example, patient admission may be supported by application compo-
nents other than the patient administration system to allow easy patient admission during
night time in a radiology department by using the RIS. Even if this conflicts with functional
leanness, it may be suitable here to have a more convenient and well-known tool in the
diagnostic area and a faster and more sophisticated tool staffing the patient administration
unit. Thus, it is the managements task to check carefully where and why there is func-
tional redundancy, because unmanaged functional redundancy may lead to functional
oversaturation and unnecessary costs.

As a consequence, these checks may lead to the necessity of declaring an application
component to be superfluous. Do not hesitate to remove those components; otherwise the
HIS will become logically oversaturated.

8.5.5
Balance of Documentation Quality and Documentation Efforts

Documentation of clinical data is needed for many purposes, such as for information
exchange within the health care team, for clinical decision making, for clinical research,
for reimbursement issues, for hospital controlling, and for legal statistics. Consequently,
many groups inside and outside the hospital profit from a complete, accurate, and timely
clinical documentation.

On the other side, high-quality documentation takes time. Physicians and nurses respon-
sible for clinical documentation may feel that the time needed for documentation reduces
#220 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

the time they have for patient care. The feeling is especially strong in institutions where
documentation is not well supported by existing tools and documentation processes.
Insufficient organization of documentation may lead to documentation which is more
time-consuming than necessary, to double documentation of the same data, and to tran-
scriptions and media cracks. This all reduces the motivation for documentation and may
lead to the feeling that documentation is not helpful but a burden. This in turn may reduce
the quality of the documented data. This fact is especially relevant if data items need to be
documented by staff that will not use these data for their own purposes. Due to the inte-
grated nature of the processes within a hospital, this is rather common.

Thus, information management carefully has to balance the amount of documentation
that is really needed for the various purposes, and the effort that health care professionals
have to invest. Well-designed documentation forms, high level of standardization, inte-
grated documentation tools, and a systematic planning of documentation help to reduce
effort and to increase the awareness that documentation is an important and indeed useful
part of clinical practice.

Exercises

8.5.6.1
Best-of-Breed Versus All-in-One

Imagine you are responsible for the HIS architecture of a newly built hospital. Two alterna-
tives are being discussed: A (DB!, AC") architecture (“all-in-one™ solution, see Fig. 6.52 as
an example) and an (AC", V") architecture (“best-of-breed” solution, see Fig. 6.48 as an
example). Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative with focus on the bal-
ance of homogeneity and heterogeneity. What would be your choice? Explain your answer.

8.5.7
Summary

Besides quality criteria, which should be fulfilled as well as possible, an optimally bal-
anced situation is also a determinant of the quality of the hospital information system. This
is a particular challenge for information management. These criteria comprise:

e Balance of homogeneity and heterogeneity: The collection of information processing
tools (at both the logical and the physical tool layer) should be as homogeneous as pos-
sible and as heterogeneous as necessary.

e Balance of computer-based and paper-based tools: The optimum of computer support
is not defined through the maximum; rather, it evolves through the various goals of the
hospital and its stakeholders as well as through the hospital functions to be supported.

e Balance of data security and working processes: The need for data security must be
balanced with the need for smooth working processes in a multi-professional and often
ad hoc working context in hospitals.
#8.6 Evaluation of Health Information Systems Quality 2

e Balance of functional leanness and functional redundancy: Functional redundancy
results in additional costs both for investment and maintenance, but there may be rea-
sons to have redundant functionality.

e Balance of documentation quality and documentation efforts: Many groups profit from
a high-quality documentation, but documentation takes time and effort. Well-designed
documentation forms, high level of standardization, integrated documentation tools,
and a systematic planning of documentation help to increase the motivation for
documentation.

As a consequence, it is hardly possible to provide information managers with a simple
checklist to find out whether the HIS is good or not. Moreover, HIS quality is a matter of
finding optima in a multidimensional space with myriads of restrictions. But this makes
information management an extraordinary interesting task.Evaluation of Health Information Systems Quality

Evaluation can be defined as the act of measuring or exploring properties of a health infor-
mation system. The result of an evaluation should give information to support decisions
concerning the HIS, such as decisions on replacing or further deploying an application com-
ponent. This definition highlights the fact that evaluation can comprise both quantitative
(“measuring”) as well as qualitative (“exploring”) aspects, and that evaluation should answer
a clear question and thus support information management decisions. Evaluation studies
can, for example, help to justify IT investments, to verify that the information system is
effective and safe, or to understand problems and to improve the information system.

In this section, we will give an introduction to evaluation methods. After reading, you
may want to look at Sect. 9.5 to find details on specific approaches and initiatives dealing
with HIS quality, such as COBIT, CCHIT, IHE, and others. After reading this section, you
should be able to answer the following questions:

e What are the major phases of an IT evaluation study?
e What are the major IT evaluation methods?

8.6.1
Typical Evaluation Phases

All quality criteria as described in the earlier sections can be evaluated in dedicated evalu-
ation projects. When planning and conducting such an evaluation study, it is necessary — as
in any empirical investigation — to follow a systematic, step-wise approach. The following
steps are recommended’:

Study Exploration

Feedback

The study exploration phase forms the basis for an evaluation study and results in a pre-
liminary outline of the study, which can be characterized by the following questions:

® Who wants the information from the evaluation study? (Identify the major sponsors for

the evaluation.)

e What is the strategic objective of the study?

eo What is the intended audience?

eo What is the organizational and political context for the evaluation studies to take

place?

® What are the major stakeholder groups that should be involved in the preparation of the

study?
e What is the available budget?

o Ts there sufficient political acceptance in the institution to go on?
#8.6 Evaluation of Health Information Systems Quality 223

This phase should end with a written approval by the relevant decision makers before
going on.

8.6.1.2
First Study Design

The First Study Design Phase has the purpose of sketching the foundation for study. The

following activities have to be done:

® establish the evaluation team,

e formulate in detail the study questions you want to answer and the evaluation criteria
you want to access;

e identify any constraints the study may have (e.g., budget, location, time, political
aspects);

o select the (quantitative or qualitative) methods you want to apply to answer your study

questions;

describe the organizational context and technical setting your study will take place in;

outline the time plan for the evaluation study and inform the involved user groups;

pay attention to any legal or ethical aspects that may occur;

decide on a strategy for reporting the evaluation results.

At the end of this phase, you should have a written agreement on the study outline.

Please note that different groups may have different evaluation questions in mind. As it
is impossible to evaluate all possible criteria, you typically will have to select the most
important ones.

8.6.1.3
Operationalization of Methods and Detailed Study Plan

This phase is dealing with the selection of an appropriate design and methods to answer the
leading questions (the information need), in accordance with the setting, the resources
(available competences, staff, time, money, readiness of the participants to take part, etc.),
and the objectives of the study. You will have to decide on study design, outcome mea-
sures, on details of the quantitative and qualitative methods (see also next section for more
details on evaluation methods), on participants, whether it is a laboratory study or a field
study, on study flow, and on project management and risk management aspects. The result
of this phase is a detailed study plan that will be followed in the next phase.

Please note that several experimental, quasi-experimental and nonexperimental study
designs can be applied to IT evaluation studies. The study design has to be carefully
selected depending on the study questions you may have. For quantitative studies that want
to prove a hypothesis (e.g., on the effect of an information system), experimental designs
(such as randomized controlled trials) are typically seen as having a higher internal valid-
ity than quasi-experimental designs (such as before-after trials or time series analysis). For
qualitative studies, nonexperimental designs such as case studies are normally chosen, but
there also exist approaches of qualitative experiments.
#224 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

8.6.1.4
Execution of Study

During this phase, the study plan is followed, that is, qualitative and/or quantitative data are
gathered and analyzed as planned. Depending on the study design, data will have to be gath-
ered at several locations and/or at several points in time. Special attention should be given to
quality of data and to any unintended factors that may influence the findings of the study.
Observations will be analyzed and interpreted to answer the original study questions.

8.6.1.5
Report and Publication of Study

The results of the study should be published in a report for the decision makers and stake-
holders of the study. In some cases, international scientific publication may also be done.
In any case, publication should follow established reporting guidelines such as the
STARE-HI guidelines."

8.6.2
Typical Evaluation Methods

8.6.2.1
Quantitative Evaluation Methods

Quantitative methods deal with quantitative data, that is, with numbers. Numbers have the
advantage that they can easily be statistically analyzed, aggregated, and compared. The
basic idea of quantitative methods is that objects have attributes (such as duration or
amount) that can be exactly measured. To get data representative for a predefined popula-
tion, a sampling is selected and then analyzed.

Typical quantitative evaluation methods comprise:

® time measurements (e.g., time-motion and work sampling);

® event counting;

® quantitative questionnaires.

Time Measurements

The time-motion analysis is based on trained observers that measure the duration of
observed events (e.g., tasks) while using a predefined list of event categories. Typically, for
time-motion analysis, one observer for one observed actor (e.g., one user) is needed. This
disadvantage is resolved by the work sampling analysis. Here, trained observers document

PSTARE-HI — Statement on Reporting of Evaluation Studies in Health Informatics. http://iig.
umit.at/efini/starehi.htm
#8.6 Evaluation of Health Information Systems Quality 225

which task is just being executed only at predefined (e.g., every 5 min) or randomly
selected time intervals. By this, they can observe several actors in parallel. By counting the
number of observed tasks in each category, the overall distribution and thus the duration of
each task can be calculated. However, to get precise numbers, a relatively large number of
observations have to be done here. Please note that both approaches (time-motion and
work sampling) are typically conducted by external trained observers, but can principally
also be conducted by the actors (e.g., users) themselves — this, however, may endanger the
quality of the data.

Event Counting

Event counting comprises observations of clinical situations or processes or analysis of
available data (e.g., log files), counting the number of events that occur in a given time
period. This can, for example, be counting of medication errors (based on an analysis of
patient records), counting the number of clicks when using certain software, counting the
number of physician-patient interactions or counting the number of patients entering a
department. As for any measurement, special attention should be given to train the
observers and to use standardized observation protocols to achieve interobserver
reliability.

Quantitative Questionnaires

Questionnaires that use standardized, closed questions lead to quantitative results. For
questionnaires addressing subjective opinions and feelings, the five-point Likert scale is
typically used (“strongly agree” — “agree” — “neither/nor” — “disagree” — “strongly dis-
agree”). The quality of data achieved by questionnaires depends on a thorough formulation
of questions and answers and an intensive pretest of the questionnaire. The available litera-
ture should thus be consulted before planning a questionnaire to ensure objectivity, reli-
ability, and validity of results. If possible, available and validated questionnaires should be
reused.

8.6.2.2
Qualitative Evaluation Methods

Qualitative methods deal with qualitative data, that is, with text and any other non-number
data. Qualitative data can describe individual situations and contexts in detail.

Typical qualitative evaluation methods comprise:

e qualitative interviews;

e qualitative observations;

e qualitative content analysis.
#226 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

Qualitative Interviews

This comprises all forms of semi- or unstructured interviews that use open questions,
thus generating free-text as results. This allows the respondent to answer freely, and it
allows interaction between interviewer and respondent. The interview can be conducted
with one or more respondent at the same time. Group interviews support interaction
between respondents, but should only be done in groups without hierarchical depen-
dencies. In any case, a pretested interview instruction is needed that describes how the
interviewer should conduct the interview and document the results. Answers are typi-
cally recorded by an audio recorder and later transcribed in verbal or aggregated proto-
cols. The analysis of the data can be done by, for example, qualitative content analysis
(see below).

Qualitative Observations

This comprises open, less-standardized, nonquantitative observations of processes or
events. In contrary to quantitative observations, the aim is not to count and measure, but to
get insight into a situation. The observations are typically documented in a field diary and/
or on predefined observation protocols. Qualitative observations generate text (such as
observer notes) that can be analyzed by qualitative content analysis. Please note that for
qualitative observation, there should be a certain familiarity of the observer with the
observed field (e.g., with the situation in the clinical department).

Qualitative Content Analysis

Text obtained from qualitative interviews or observations can be analyzed by a meth-
odological, planned approach based on categories. Here, the material is stepwise ana-
lyzed and coded into several available categories. The categories can either be defined
beforehand (deductive approach), they can be developed while reading and analyzing
the text (inductive approach), or they can be defined beforehand and refined while ana-
lyzing the text (mixed approach). The coding of text into categories should be repro-
ducible; it must therefore be clearly documented and explained by so-called anchor
examples. Typically, the text material is read and coded more than once to make sure
that nothing is overlooked, and that the categories are homogeneous and all filled with
text examples. Based on the categories and the text passages that are related to them,
the text can then be further analyzed to identify larger patterns and to answer the study
questions.

8.6.2.3
Special Evaluation Studies

The quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods described above form the basis for
special types of evaluation studies. The following list presents some examples.
#8.6 Evaluation of Health Information Systems Quality 227

e User survey: Quantitative analysis of user satisfaction with an application component.

® Delphi survey: Consensus method for the prediction of the future. A panel of experts is
surveyed on a given topic in several iterative rounds. The result of each round is pre-
sented to each expert in anonymized form; the experts are then invited to modify their
judgment in the next round.

eo SWOT analysis: Quantitative and/or qualitative analysis of the most significant
strengths (positive features), weaknesses (negative features), opportunities (potential
strengths), and threats (potential weaknesses) that characterize an information system
component.

eo Effectiveness study: Quantitative analysis of the effects of an information system
component.

eo Cost-effectiveness analysis: An economic analysis to compare the costs and conse-
quences of an information system component. It does not require that all important
effects and benefits are expressed in monetary terms.

e Cost-benefit analysis: An economic analysis that converts effects of an information
system component into the same monetary terms as the costs and compares them.

e Utility analysis: An economic analysis that compares costs and consequences of an
information system component, taking personal preferences into account by including
weighting factors for each criterion.

e Return-on-investment (ROT) study: An economic analysis that describes how much an
investment on an information system component paid back in a fixed period of time.

o Usability study: Assessment of the user friendliness of an IT component with special
focus on the interaction between an IT component and its users.

Exercises

8.6.3.1
Selection of Evaluation Criteria

It seems quite clear that you cannot evaluate all possible evaluation criteria as defined in
this chapter in one evaluation study. Imagine that you were asked to “evaluate the new RIS
system in the Department of Radiology.” How would you proceed to come to a subset of
criteria? Which stakeholder groups would you involve in decision making? What would be
your role during this process?

8.6.3.2
Planning of an Evaluation Study

Your task is now to prepare the RIS evaluation study mentioned before. You decided to
focus on the cost-benefit ratio of this application component. Define an adequate evalua-
tion plan. What would be the detailed questions? What measuring methods would be used?
‘What would be an adequate study design? Discuss the different possibilities.

Please look at example 8.7.3. Which method is used to assess quality of care? Can you

8.6.4
Summary

Evaluation studies should follow a well-defined structured approach comprising: study
exploration, first study design, operationalization of methods and detailed study plan, exe-
cution of study, and report and publication of study. Special emphasis has to be put on the
clear formulation of the evaluation criteria that are investigated.

There are quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods. Typical quantitative meth-
ods comprise time measurement, event counting, and user surveys. Typical qualitative
methods comprise qualitative interviews, qualitative observations, and qualitative data
analysis. Special evaluation studies comprise user surveys, Delphi surveys, SWOT analy-
sis, several economic analyses, and usability studies. The challenge is to select the ade-
quate evaluation method for each evaluation criterion.Summarizing Examples

The following examples present various attempts to describe quality criteria for HIS.

health care networks, ambulatory care units, long-term-care facilities, and laboratories.
Accreditation means to certify that an institution meets predefined quality standards. Joint
Commission standards are nationally recognized as those that are conducive to providing
a high standard of patient care. External evaluation is done at regular time intervals (e.g.,
3 years).

The Joint Commission has defined standards that must be fulfilled to achieve accredita-
tion. Those standards comprise, for example, aspects of patient care, data security, and
staff management. Among others, the Joint Commission also defines the following major
information management standards:

1. The hospital plans and designs information management processes to meet internal
and external information needs that are appropriate for the hospital’s size and
complexity.

2. Confidentiality, security, and integrity of data and information are maintained.

. Uniform data definitions and data capture methods are used whenever possible.

4. Decision makers and other appropriate staff members are educated and trained in the
principles of information management.

5. Transmission of data and information is timely and accurate, and the formats for dis-
seminating data and information are standardized.

6. Adequate data integration and data interpretation capabilities are provided.

7. The hospital defines, captures, analyzes, transforms, transmits, and reports patient-
specific data and information related to care processes and outcomes.

8. The hospital collects and analyzes aggregate data to support patient care and operations.

9. The hospital provides systems, resources, and services to meet its needs for knowl-
edge-based information in patient care, education, research, and management.

10. Comparative performance data and information are defined, collected, analyzed,
transmitted, reported, and used consistently with national and state guidelines for data
set parity and connectivity.

The information management standards are further divided into several subsections. For

example, the subsections of information management standard number 7 comprise among

others the following criteria:

e The institution initiates and maintains a medical record for every individual assessed or
treated.

e The medical records contain sufficient information to identify the patient, support the
diagnosis, justify the treatment, and document the course and results accurately.

® At discharge from inpatient care, a clinical resume concisely summarizes the reason for
hospitalization, the significant findings, the procedures performed and treatment ren-
dered, the patient’s condition on discharge, and any specific instructions given to the
patient and/or family, as pertinent.

e All significant clinical information pertaining to a patient is entered into the medical
record as soon as possible after its occurrence.

o All entries in medical records are dated and authenticated, and a method is established
to identify the authors of entries.

8.7.3
The Baby CareLink Study

Baby CareLink is a telemedicine program that incorporates videoconferencing and World
Wide Web technologies to enhance interactions among families, staff, and community
providers during the treatment of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. The videoconfer-
encing module allows virtual visits and distance learning from a family’s home during an
infant’s hospitalization as well as virtual house calls and remote monitoring after dis-
charge. Baby CareLink’s WWW site contains information on issues that confront these
families. It also allows sharing of patient-based data and communications among autho-
rized hospital and community users.

In a randomized trial of Baby CareLink comprising 30 control and 25 study patients, a
standardized 80-item survey using a five-point-Likert scale was administered to the participat-
ing families after discharge, to assess their satisfaction with the quality of care. It could be
shown that families in the CareLink group were significantly more satisfied and reported sig-
nificantly fewer problems with the quality of care. The duration of hospitalization was similar
in the two groups, but all infants in the CareLink group were discharged directly to home,
whereas 20% of control infants were transferred to community hospitals before ultimately
being discharged to home. Overall, CareLink significantly improved family satisfaction with
inpatient VLBW care and lowered costs associated with hospital-to-hospital transfer.

In-Depth Approach: The Functional Redundancy Rate

The easier quality criteria for HIS are computable, the more frequent they will be used. A
prerequisite of computability, however, is the formal description of criteria.

'5This example is based on Gray JE, Safran C, Davis RB, et al. Baby CareLink: Using the Internet
and telemedicine to improve care for high-risk infants. Pediatrics. 2000;106(6):1318-1324.
#8.7 Summarizing Examples 231

As we experienced in the previous sections, the metamodel 3LGM?2 (recall Sect. 5.3) is
helpful for describing architectures of HIS. We will now show a little bit more in detail
how 3LGM?2-based models can be used to automatically compute a particular quality cri-
terion, which is the functional redundancy rate (FRR). On that basis we want to support
information managers to find answers to the following question:

eo How many application components in my HIS can be shut down without loss of
functionality?

Functional redundancy deals with the adequate relationship between enterprise functions
and application components to support these tasks. We can model this support relationship,
that is, a part of the interlayer relationships mentioned in Sect. 5.3.2.4, by a matrix SUP.
Let EF :={EF,, EF}, P > 0be a set of enterprise functions, and AC ={4C,, AC},
N > 0 a set of application components.
The two-dimensional matrix SUP describing the relationship between enterprise functions
and application components is defined as SUP :=(sup,,,) 1 p,1.v with

Lif function ef is supported by application component ac,
sup,, =] Oelse

Let us look at the following example: Suppose a set of enterprise functions
EF:={4,B,C.D,E,F,G}, where the letters represent enterprise functions as follows: 4 for
medical admission, B for administrative admission (inpatients), C for administrative
admission (outpatients), D for execution of radiology diagnostics, E for decision making,
F for visitor and information service, and G for medical and nursing care planning.
Additionally, suppose a set of application components 4C:={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, where the
numbers represent application components as follows: (7) for medical documentation sys-
tem, (2) for patient administration system, (3) for cardiovascular information system, (4)
for RIS, (5) for decision support system, (6) for pharmacy information system, (7) for
pathology information system, (8) for dialysis information system, and (9) for teleradiol-
ogy system.

Table 8.1 contains the matrix SUP describing the interlayer relationships between these
functions and application components, whereas Fig. 8.6 illustrates these relationships.

Fig.8.6 Matrix SUP: rectangles denote enterprise functions, rounded rectangles denote application
components, and connecting lines illustrate a “1” in the respective position of the matrix, that is,
that a certain enterprise function is supported by a certain application component. For example,
enterprise function E decision making can be supported by application component 5 decision sup-
port system or T pathology information system alternatively

In order to reduce complexity of the HIS it is interesting to know which application
components could be omitted without loss of functionality, that is, without hindering the
execution of any enterprise function. Before we define a measure for functional redun-
dancy we want to explain, how we can detect redundant support of enterprise functions by
application components.

For every enterprise function ef, € EF we can easily calculate isup, := p) sup,

Every isup, denotes the number of application components actually supporting the indi-
vidual enterprise function ef, ; we call it its individual degree of support by application
components. Every isup > 1 may be an indicator that some application components are
dispensable, with isup -1 indicating the number of possibly superfluous components.
However, this number needs a careful investigation because some of the apparently super-
fluous application components may be necessary for other enterprise functions. Obviously,
measuring functional redundancy in a way, which is supportive for information manage-
ment, needs a measure, which takes these interrelationships into account.

Continuing part 1 of our example we can easily calculate isup, as shown in Table 8.2.

Table 8.2 isup,
PC NY SORT
QO 9 mg aw »
#8.7 Summarizing Examples 233

The value of isup,=4 indicates that perhaps there are three superfluous application
components supporting C (administrative admission (outpatients)). But detailed analysis
shows that the application components / (medical documentation system), 2 (patient
administration system), and 4 (RIS) cannot be omitted, because they are needed for the
functions 4 (medical admission), B (administrative admission (inpatients)), and D (exe-
cution of radiology diagnostics). However, application component 3 (cardiovascular
information system) seems to be a good candidate for being removed from this informa-
tion system because function C as the only function it supports is also supported by
application components /, 2, and 4. A measure of redundancy should, therefore, correctly
indicate that considering the enterprise function C (administrative admission (outpa-
tients)) only one application component could be omitted (namely, cardiovascular infor-
mation system).

How can an algorithm automatically check, whether particular application components
can be omitted or not, given EF, AC and SUP?

The challenge is to calculate a minimal subset AC™" < AC of application components,
which guarantees that all functions are supported and that there are no superfluous applica-
tion components in use. Each set AC™" we call a “minimal functionally nonredundant set
of application components.” In general, there is more than one such set AC™" for a given
information system, that is, there is more than one way to cut down functional

redundancy.
Let us describe any subset AC’ ¢ AC of application components being actually in use

by a vector USE, indicating whether application components are member of the subset
AC’ or not: USE :=(use,),_, , with

’ ifac, € AC’
use, = -

0 else

Hence, AC™" can be described by USE :=(use]"),_..y and use" €{0,1}. Given what
application components are in use, that is, given the respective vector USE, we can calcu-
late the individual degree of support for all enterprise functions as well as:

ISUP' = SUP*USE with TSP = (isup )As stated above, we want that, despite of some application components being not in use,

-1.p"

every function is supported by at least one application component. We introduce a vector
€ oflength P containing only “1”: € = {) with e, :=Lp=1._P.Now we can state the first postulation (P1): For every vector USE, which is as a candi-
date for being considered as a possible reduced set of application components, the follow-
ing constraint holds: SUP USE > &” -

Second, we want to have as few application components in use as possible. We intro-

duce a vector & of length N containing only “~17": ¢ = (c, I. with ¢, :=-1,n=1..N.

This leads to the second postulation (P1): ¢” * USE — max.
#234 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

Since SUP is a matrix of zeroes and ones, we have a pure 0-1 linear programming prob-
lem. This particular problem here is well known in literature as the “set covering problem.”
Corresponding to our statement that there will be more than one “minimal functionally
nonredundant set of application components” there are also different solutions for the set
covering problem.

The simplest algorithm for computing these solutions, known as “brute-force,”
checks all combinations of application components for postulations (P1) and (P2). Of
course this would need too much computing resources for realistic information sys-
tems with several tenths of application components. Moreover, set covering is an
NP-complete problem generally, which, roughly, means that the complexity of any
algorithm will be in the order of an exponential function of N. Fortunately, for usual
models of a HIS certain assumptions can be made, which can be used to define a heu-
ristic algorithm. The 3LGM? tool (see footnote 8 in Chap. 5) provides such an algo-
rithm, which actually computes solutions for this particular set covering problem even
in large HIS models very fast.

The solution is a set USE™ of all vectors USE; i= use) __,» for which (P1) and

(P2) hold. The set is defined as USE™ = {user user" }

This corresponds with the set 4C™" = {acr™ LACE" ¢ of minimal functionally
nonredundant sets of application components AC}. In the sense of the set covering prob-
lem we could say every AC" covers EF. Because of (P2), all those sets AC, AC are of the

same cardinality M = act].

‘We can now define Functional Redundancy Rate (FRR) as FRR =

FRR can be interpreted as the percentage of application components, which could be
removed from the information system without loss of functionality.

Since the given information system in our example is very small, we can immediately
identify two minimal functionally nonredundant configurations without using complicated
algorithms, but by merely looking accurately at Fig. 8.6:

ACT" ={1,2,4,5,6} and AC;" ={1,2,4,6,7}, which correspond to the vectors
USE, =(1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0) and USE» =(1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0).
For USE!" as one of the two minimal solutions in our example holds:
SUP*USE, = (asp )- (1,1,3,1,1,1,1) (see Table 8.3).

Thus, (P1) holds for SUP. In the same way (P1) can be shown to hold for ISUP> as
well.

FRR is only dependent on N and on M, being the number of application components
and the cardinality of all minimal functionally nonredundant sets of application compo-
nents, respectively. With N=9 and M=S5, we get: FRR = 2-5 5 > =0,44.

Hence, 44% of the application components in our example could be removed.

Joint Commission Information Management Standards

Please look at the ten major Joint Commission Information Management Standards pre-
sented in Sect. 8.7.2. Analyze how they correspond to the quality criteria for structures, for
processes, and for outcomes as described in this chapter. To which quality criteria can they
be matched?Summary

Three major approaches to quality assessment are typically distinguished: quality of struc-
tures, quality of processes, and quality of outcome. Quality characteristics may help to
describe “HIS diseases,” find “HIS diagnoses,” and derive adequate “HIS therapies.”

In the context of hospital information systems, quality of structures refers to the avail-
ability of resources needed for information processing. It comprises quality of data, quality
#236 8 Quality of Health Information Systems

of computer-based application components, quality of physical data processing systems,
and quality of HIS architecture.

Quality of processes deals with the quality of the information processes, which are
necessary to meet the user’s needs. It comprises single recording and multiple usability of
data, no transcription of data, leanness of information processing tools, efficiency of infor-
mation logistics, and patient-centered information processing.

Quality of outcome describes whether the goals of information management have been
reached, or, in a broader sense, to what extent the hospital information system contributes
to the goals of the hospital and to the expectations of different stakeholders, and the fulfill-
ment of information management laws.

It is a particular challenge for information management to take into account those crite-
ria where only an adequate balance is a determinant of the quality of a hospital information
system. This comprises the balance of homogeneity and heterogeneity, the balance of
computer-based and paper-based tools, the balance of data security and working processes,
the balance of functional leanness and functional redundancy, and the balance of documen-
tation quality and documentation efforts.

Evaluation studies should follow a well-defined, structured approach, comprising:
study exploration; first study design; operationalization of methods and detailed study
plan; execution of study; and report and publication of study.

Evaluation methods that can be used comprise quantitative methods such as time mea-
surement, event counting, and user surveys, and qualitative methods such as qualitative
interviews, qualitative observations, and qualitative data analysis.
#Strategic Information Management
in HospitalsIntroduction

Until now we have discussed how health information systems look like and how their qual-
ity can be described and measured. We will now examine how high quality health informa-
tion systems can be achieved and how high quality can be maintained, especially in
hospitals.

High quality HIS can only by achieved and HIS failures can only be prevented if the
HIS are systematically planned, monitored and directed. We summarize this triad by the
term ‘information management’.

In this chapter, we will first differentiate information management with regard to differ-
ent scopes. Hence we introduce definitions for strategic, tactical and operational informa-
tion management. But this chapter, like the entire book, will focus on strategic information
management. Systematic information management as a whole requires clear organiza-
tional structures. Implementing these is one of the first tasks of strategic information
management. After discussing appropriate organizational structures for information
management in hospitals we will explain what planning, monitoring and directing means
especially in a strategic context.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What does information management mean and how can strategic, tactical and opera-
tional information management be differentiated?

‘What organizational structures are appropriate for information management in hospitals?
‘What are the tasks and methods for strategic HIS planning?

‘What are the tasks and methods for strategic HIS monitoring?

‘What are the tasks and methods for strategic HIS directing?

How can experts for information management in hospitals be gained?

#238 9 Strategic Information Management in HospitalsStrategic, Tactical and Operational Information Management

In this section, we present in more detail the tasks of information management in hospitals.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

® What does information management in general and in hospitals encompass?

e What are the three main scopes of information management?

e What are the tasks of strategic, tactical, and operational information management in
hospitals?

eo What is meant by IT service management and how is it related to information
management?

9.2.1
Information Management

The concept ‘management’ can stand for an institution or for an enterprise function
(see Sect. 6.3.3.8 and footnote 3 in Chap. 6). As an institution, management comprises
all organizational units of an enterprise that make decisions about planning, monitor-
ing, and directing all activities of subordinate units. As an enterprise function, manage-
ment comprises all leadership activities that determine the enterprise’s goals, structures,
and activities.

‘We can distinguish between (general) management dealing with the enterprise as a whole
and management dealing with distinguishable units of the enterprise. The management of
the business unit information processing is called information management. In general,
information management should contribute to fulfill strategic enterprise goals. Information
management in an enterprise manages its information system and thus deals with the fol-
lowing objects:

e enterprise functions and entity types,

e application components, and

e physical data processing systems.

Information management

e plans the information system of an enterprise and its architecture,

e directs its establishment and its operation, and

® monitors its development and operation with respect to the planned objectives.

Different management scopes have different perceptions and interests. Hence, it is helpful to

divide information management with regard to its scope into strategic, tactical, and opera-

tional management, which all comprise as main tasks planning, directing, and monitoring.

o Strategic information management deals with the enterprise’s information processing
as a whole and establishes strategies and principles for the evolution of the information
system. An important result of strategic management activities is a strategic informa-
tion management plan.
#9.2 Strategic, Tactical and Operational Information Management 239

o Tactical information management deals with particular enterprise functions or

application components that are introduced, removed, or changed. Usually these
activities are done in the form of projects. Such tactical information management
projects are initiated by strategic information management. Thus, strategic infor-
mation management is a vital necessity for tactical information management. The
result of tactical information management projects is the enterprise information
system.

® Operational information management is responsible for operating the components of
the information system. It cares for its smooth operation in accordance with the strate-
gic information management plan. Additionally, operational information management
plans, directs and monitors permanent services for the users of the information
system.

This separation is essential because each of these information management scopes has dif-
ferent perspectives, and therefore uses different methods and tools. For example, strategic
information management focuses on strategic information management plans (compare
Sect. 9.4.3). Tactical management needs, for example, methods for project management,
user requirements analysis, and software development or customizing. Operational man-
agement requires methods and tools for topics that range from intra-enterprise marketing
of services to service desk and network management.

Figure 9.1 presents the relationships among strategic, tactical, and operational
information management. Within strategic information management a strategic infor-
mation management plan has to be created as result of planning activities. This
depends clearly on strategic goals of the enterprise, which are given by the strategic
enterprise management. Since the strategic information management plan contains a
list of projects to be performed in the coming years (compare Sect. 9.4.3), strategic
directing means to initiate these projects as tasks of tactical information management.
Strategic monitoring collects different information regarding the state of the informa-
tion system, its operation, users’ opinions and directives of the strategic enterprise
management. Within each project of tactical information management the course of
the project has to be planned (project plan) and the project will be directed according
to this plan. The results are components (application components and/or physical data
processing systems) of the information system. Again, monitoring is needed in col-
lecting information of the information system’s state and deriving consequences for
the respective projects but also for strategic decisions. When a project ends, the results
have to be operated and thus we enter the scope of operational information
management.

Management comprises only those tasks that are nonexecutive. Therefore, operational
tasks (such as operating a computer server) are not part of management’s tasks. However,
those operational tasks have to be planned, directed, and monitored. This is carried out by
operational information management.

Figure 9.2 presents a three-dimensional classification of information management
activities. It shows the three objects of information management (functions, application
components, and physical data processing systems), the three tasks (planning, directing,
monitoring), and the three scopes (strategic, tactical, operational).

9.2.2
Information Management in Hospitals

We can now apply the defined management concepts to the enterprise “hospital”.
Information management in hospitals is the management of hospital information systems;
hence we can use “HIS management” as a synonym. The tasks of information management
in hospitals are:

e planning the hospital information system and its architecture;

e directing its establishment and its operation;

e monitoring its development and operation with respect to the planned objectives.

Information management in hospitals is performed in an environment full of influencing
factors. For example, decisions made by the hospital’s management directly influence
information management (e.g., a decision to cooperate in a health care network). New
legal regulations have an effect on information management (e.g., a law enforcing the
introduction of a new billing system based on patient grouping). Patients and users of
the hospital information system with their values, attitudes, comments, demands, and
fears also influence information management. On the other side, information manage-
ment itself may affect, for example, the management of the enterprise (e.g., information
management may propose to introduce a hospital-wide, multiprofessional electronic
patient record system; this must in turn lead to strategic activities such as process
reorganization).

Figure 9.3 presents this relationship between HIS management and HIS operation, and
the influencing factors.

agement in hospitals.

9.2.3
Strategic Information Management

Strategic information management deals with the hospital’s information processing as a
whole. It depends strictly on the hospital’s business strategy and strategic goals and has

to translate these into an appropriate information strategy. The planning activities of
strategic information management result in a specific strategic information manage-
ment plan. This plan includes the direction and strategy of information management and
gives directives for the construction and development of the hospital information sys-
tem by describing its intended architecture. A proposal for the structure and content of
strategic information management plans is presented in Sect. 9.4.3. The strategic infor-
mation management plan is the basis for strategic project portfolios. They contain con-
crete projects, which implement the objectives of the strategy, and shall be revised
regularly. For example, the strategic information management plan might contain the
introduction of a clinical information system on all wards within the next 2 years to
provide health care professionals with the right information, in the right place, at the
right time. The strategic project portfolios could then contain individual projects, for
example, on decision making, planning and organization of patient treatment, order
entry, and medical admission.

Directing as part of strategic information management means to transform the strate-
gic information management plan into action, that is, to systematically manipulate the
hospital information system to make it conform to the strategic plan. The system’s manip-
ulation is usually done by the initiation of projects of the strategic project portfolio. The
projects deal with the construction or further development and maintenance of compo-
nents of the hospital information system. Planning, directing, and monitoring these proj-
ects are the tasks of tactical information management. Operational management will then
be responsible for the proper operation of the components. An example of strategic direct-
ing would be to initiate a project for the introduction of a provider/physician order entry
system.

Monitoring as part of strategic information management means continuously auditing
HIS quality as defined by means of its strategic information management plan’s directives
and goals. Auditing should determine whether the hospital information system is able to
fulfill its tasks efficiently, that is, whether it can contribute significantly to the hospital’s
goals (Sect. 8.4.1), meet the stakeholders’ expectations (Sect. 8.4.2) and fulfill the laws
(Sect. 8.4.3).

The managements task is to install “sensors” to audit the information system’s quality
(compare Sect. 8). Management has to receive information from the current projects, from
operational management, from users, and from the various stakeholders. Additional infor-
mation can be gained through evaluation projects (see Sect. 8.6).

Monitoring results are used as input for the directing tasks of information management,
which could for example initiate further projects. Monitoring results will also give feed-
back to update the strategic information management plan, which could for example lead
to further activities of strategic management.

Strategic information management and its strategic information management plan are
the vital requirements for tactical and operational information management in a hospital.
#9.2 Strategic, Tactical and Operational Information Management 243

9.24
Tactical Information Management

Tactical information management deals with particular enterprise functions or application
components. It aims to introduce, remove, change, or maintain components of the hospital

information system. Such a component could be a provider/physician order entry system.
Related activities are usually performed within projects. These projects have to be initiated
as part of an information strategy, which is formulated in the project portfolio of a strategic
information management plan as drawn up by the strategic information management. The
result of all tactical information management projects is the HIS itself.

The organization of the operation and maintenance of information processing tools is
part of operational information management. However, if problems occur during the oper-
ation of HIS components (e.g., frequent user complaints about a medical documentation
system), appropriate projects may be executed by tactical information management (e.g.,
introducing a better version of the medical documentation system). Typically, those tactical
information management projects comprise a planning phase, a running phase (which
could contain, for example, system analysis, evaluation, selection, specification, or intro-
duction), and a finishing phase (see Fig. 9.4).

Planning in tactical information management means planning projects and all the
resources needed for them. Even though tactical information management projects are
based on the strategic plan, they need a specific tactical project plan. This plan has to
describe the project’s subject and motivation, the problems to be solved, the goals to be
achieved, the tasks to be performed, and the activities to be undertaken to reach the
goals.Project initiation

Directing in tactical management means the execution of such tactical information
management projects in hospitals, based on a project plan. Therefore, it includes typical
tasks of project management such as resource allocation and coordination, motivation and
training of the staff, etc.

Monitoring means continually checking whether the initiated projects are running as
planned and whether they will produce the expected results. Monitoring results influence
project planning, as a project’s plan may be updated or changed according to the results of
the project’s monitoring in a given situation.

9.2.5
Operational Information Management

Operational information management is responsible for operating the components of the
hospital information system. It has to care for its operation in accordance with the strategic

information management plan.

Planning in operational information management means planning organizational
structures, procedures, and all resources such as finances, staff, rooms, or buildings that
are necessary to ensure the faultless operation of all components of the hospital infor-
mation system. For example, operational information management may require the
installation of a service desk and a service support system that enables the quick trans-
mission of users’ error notes to the responsible services. Such systems but also respec-
tive staff resources need to be available for a longer period of time. Therefore, they
should be allocated as part of a strategic information management plan. Moreover,
planning in this context concerns the allocation of personnel resources on a day-to-day
basis (e.g., planning of shifts for staff responsible for user support or network
management).

Directing means the sum of all management activities that are necessary to ensure
proper responses to operating problems of components of the hospital information sys-
tem, that is, to provide backup facilities, to operate a service desk, to maintain servers,
and to keep task forces available for repairing network components, servers, personal
computers, printers, etc. Directing in this context deals with engaging the resources
planned by the strategic information management plan in such a way that faultless opera-
tion of the hospital information system is ensured. Operational information management
does not mean to exchange a server, but to organize the necessary services and
resources.

Monitoring deals with caring for the verification of the proper working and effective-
ness of components of the hospital information system. For example, a network monitor-
ing system may regularly be used to monitor the availability and correct working of
network components (compare Fig. 9.5).

To guarantee the continuous operation of the most important components of a HIS, it is
helpful to draw up a concept for operational information management. Such a concept
should clarify the following:
#9.2 Strategic, Tactical and Operational Information Management 245

Fig.9.5 Monitoring of
the server of a
hospital information
system

‘Which components have to be supported?

‘What tasks comprise operational support?

‘Who is responsible for the operational support?
‘What should be the intensity of operational support?

Typically, three levels of operational support can be distinguished. First-level support is the
first address for all user groups with any kind of problem. It may consist, for example, of a
central 24-h-hotline (service desk) that is responsible for the management of user accounts
and first trouble shooting, or of decentralized information processing staff. When the first-
level support cannot solve the problems, it hands them over to the second-level support,
specially trained informatics staff in the central information management department who are
usually responsible for the operation of the specific application components. The third-level
support, finally, addresses the most severe problems that cannot be solved by the second-level
support. It can consist, for example, of specialists from the software vendor (Fig. 9.6).

Table 9.1 presents objects, responsibilities, tasks, and the intensity that should be
defined as part of the operational management concept for the computer-based part of a
HIS. As an example, a concept for operational management in a hospital could clarify

Relationship Between IT Service Management and Information Management

IT service management (ITSM) is information management centered on the customer’s per-
spective of IT’s contribution to the business, in contrast to technology-centered approaches.
It comprises all measures and methods that are necessary to support the business processes.
#9.2 Strategic, Tactical and Operational Information Management 247

Fig.9.6 An immediate support center for third-level support of a vendor

Independent of how an institution defines the term “service,” there must be an added value
for the customer. If, for example, the nurse does not have to call the laboratory for a quick
test result but has it immediately available on her portable, it gives her an added value because
she can concentrate on her core functions. So, IT Service Management has the task to design,
provide, deliver and improve such customer-centered services. The IT Infrastructure Library
(ITIL) is the de-facto standard framework for IT Service management. ITIL was developed
for the British Government in order to define best practices for all governmental computing
centers. In its version 3, the phases of ITIL are described in five core publications:

® service strategy,

service design,

service transition,

service operation,

continual service improvement.

These publications comprise 26 processes which range from strategic alignment of the IT
to continual improvement of processes. Among others, ITIL V3 defines a Service Lifecycle
consisting of a circle of service design, service transition and service operation. Service
operation usually influences new service designs — and the circle moves on.

Many hospitals use ITIL for selected information management tasks, but have not
already implemented the whole lifecycle. Typical ITIL processes that can often be found
implemented in hospitals are in the phase of service operation the incident management
process and the problem management process, the service desk, and in the phase of
service transition the change management and the service asset and configuration
management.

ITIL conformant information management processes may be part of strategic, tactical,
and operational information management as best practice.

9.2.9
Summary

Information management in hospitals is a complex task. To reduce complexity, we distinguish
between strategic, tactical, and operational information management. Each of these infor-
mation management scopes has different perspectives and uses other methods and tools.

The tasks of information management are:

e planning of a hospital information system and its architecture;

e directing its establishment and its operation;

e monitoring its development and operation with respect to the planned objectives.

IT Service Management comprises tasks of all scopes of information management but
emphasizes that information management should be regarded as a service offered by the
information management department to a customer in or outside the hospital.Organizational Structures of Information Management

Organizational structures for information management in hospitals differ greatly among
hospitals. In general, each hospital should have an adequate organization for strategic,
tactical, and operational information management, depending on its size, its internal orga-
nization, and its needs.

Organizational structures can be defined at the overall hospital level (e.g., a chief infor-
mation officer (CIO), a central information management department), and at the depart-
mental level (e.g., specific information management staff for a certain department, a certain
outpatient unit).

9.3.1
Chief Information Officer

It is generally useful to centralize responsibilities for information management in one role.
This role is usually called chief information officer (CIO); but the role is also often called
vice president (or director) of information systems (or information services, information
management, information and communication technology, information resources) or chief
of information services.

The CIO bears the overall responsibility for the strategic, tactical, and operational
management of the information system and the budgetary responsibility, and has the
authority for all employees concerned with information management. The specific posi-
tion of the CIO demands dedicated professional skills. Of course health/medical informat-
ics competencies are required. But additionally more general executive and managerial
competencies, and business and economic competencies are necessary as well.
#250 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

Depending on the size of the hospital, the role and the tasks of a CIO may be performed by
one dedicated person (e.g., a full-time health/medical informatics specialist) or by a high-
ranking member of the hospital’s board (e.g., the chief executive officer, CEO). The CIO
may be supported by an information management board. Such a board can often be found
in larger hospitals (Fig. 9.7). Members should include one representative from the hospi-
tal’s board of directors, representatives from the main departments and user groups, and
the director of the information management department (see Sect. 9.3.2) if this director is
not the CIO simultaneously. If no dedicated CIO position exists, the president of this board
can be regarded as the CIO of the hospital.

The CIO should report directly to the CEO or the hospital’s board of directors and,
therefore, should be ranked rather high in the hospital’s organizational hierarchy, opti-
mally as a member of the top management team of the hospital. The CIO’s role
should be a strategic one that comprises the following tasks of strategic information
management.

e make or prepare all relevant strategic decisions on the HIS, especially with respect to
infrastructure, architecture, and information management organization;

align the hospital’s business plan with the strategic information management plan;
establish and promote the strategic information management plan;

initiate and control projects for tactical information management,

initiate HIS evaluation studies and adequate HIS monitoring activities;

identify and solve serious information management problems;

report to the CEO or the hospital’s board of directors.

mation management departments director, the director of the information management department, a

director of a medical research department as representative of the medical faculty and medical school,
the director of nursing. The director of finance and vice-director of administration took the photo
#9.3 Organizational Structures of Information Management 251

The CIO’s membership in the top management team should provide the possibility to
influence the hospital’s strategies using information technology as a strategic resource.
Therefore, business knowledge and the ability to effectively communicate with other busi-
ness managers, for example the chief financial officer (CFO) or the chief operating officer
(COO), is important for a CIO. Nevertheless, reality often differs greatly from this image.
‘Whether the role of the CIO is a strategic one or a more tactical or even operational one
depends on internal hospital factors such as the CIO’s top management membership, the
internal communication networks among top executives and the CIO, the top manage-
ment’s strategic knowledge about ICT, the hospital’s strategic vision of ICT, and on the
personal skills of the CIO.

9.3.2
Information Management Department

There is usually one central information management department (often called the depart-
ment for medical informatics, hospital computing center, or ICT department). This unit
takes care at least of the tactical and operational information management of those parts
of the HIS with hospital-wide relevance (e.g., the enterprise resource planning system, the
clinical information system, and the computer network). In larger hospitals, there may be
subdivisions with respect to tasks (e.g., different units for desktop management, user sup-
port, clinical systems, or networking).

If the information management department also cares of strategic information manage-
ment, the head of this department is typically the CIO.

‘With regard to the responsibilities for tactical and operational information management,
it is sometimes not useful and often not feasible to totally centralize these services.
Especially in larger hospitals, they are performed in cooperation between central units and
the decentralized staff. This staff may be dedicated medical informaticians or especially
skilled users. These local information managers have responsibilities for tactical and oper-
ational information management with regard to their department, but in accordance with
the central information management department. For example, they may (with support
from the central unit) introduce a hospital-wide application component in their department,
and operate it. On the other hand, they will also take care of additional information needs
oftheir departments, for example by introducing a dedicated departmental system. However,
this should be done only in accordance with the strategic information management plan.

Summary

Each hospital should have an adequate organization for strategic, tactical and operational
information management.

In general, a chief information officer (CIO) is responsible for information manage-
ment. The CIO’s most important tasks should be the strategic alignment of business plans
and the strategic information management plan. She or he is responsible for all scopes of
information management in the hospital.

There is typically one central department for information management. Usually the
CIO directs this department. In addition, there may also be decentralized information man-
agement staff, located at the individual departments of the hospital. But this staff has to be
coordinated by the CIO as well.
#254 9 Strategic Information Management in HospitalsStrategic Planning

We will now focus on strategic information management. Strategic planning is the first
step of a systematic strategic information management process and leads to a strategic
information management plan as basis. It comprises planning of the HIS architecture and
of the organization of information management.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

® What are the typical tasks for strategic HIS planning?

® What are the typical methods for strategic HIS planning?

eo What is the goal and typical structure of a strategic information management
plan?

9.4.1
Tasks

The most important tasks of strategic HIS planning are strategic alignment of business
plans and strategic information management plans, long-term HIS planning, and short-
term HIS planning.

94.1.1
Aligning Business Plans and Information Management Plans

The basis for strategic information management in a hospital are the strategic goals as
defined in the hospital's business plan. Advances in ICT may influence these strategic
business goals. Therefore, it is one main task of strategic information management to align
business plans and strategic information management plans. Hospitals aim to provide effi-
cient, high-quality health care. However, this mission may be further refined by goals as in
Sect. 8.4.1, for example.

Different hospitals may choose different subsets of these goals, which would result in
different information management strategies and different architectures of HIS. If hospital
chosen goals are conflicting, strategic information management must try to solve these
conflicts and establish a clear order of priorities, in accordance with the enterprise’s busi-
ness plan.

It is obvious that the CIO as person in charge for strategic information management
needs knowledge about the enterprise strategy and the enterprise business plan. But also,
the hospital’s management needs knowledge about the potential of information processing
with regard to formulation, realization, and evaluation of the hospital’s strategy. Strategic
#9.4 Strategic Planning 255

information management must be able to offer this information to hospital management in
adequate and understandable form. Methods for strategic alignment are presented in the
methods section, below.

9.4.1.2
Long-Term HIS Planning

Strategic planning of HIS distinguishes between long-term and short-term HIS
planning.

The strategic information management plan contains the results of long-term planning
of HIS. It describes the hospital’s goals, the information management goals, the current
HIS state, the future HIS state, and the steps to transform the current HIS into the planned
HIS. Strategic information management must create and regularly update this plan. The
strategic plan must take into account quality criteria for HIS structures, processes, and
outcome. It must be guaranteed that the strategic information management plan is the basis
for all other information management activities. HIS planning is an ongoing process, and
there is no use in trying to solve all problems at the same time. Solely a stepwise approach,
based on different levels of priorities, is possible and useful. The strategic information
management plan, therefore, must contain a general priority list of most important projects
to be done in the coming years.

The long-term strategic information management plan is usually valid for a longer
period of time (e.g., 3-5 years). However, requirements (e.g., due to legal changes or new
user requests) and resources (staff, money) may change quicker than the strategic informa-
tion management plan; or strategic monitoring (see Sect. 9.5) results may require an
adjustment.

The detailed structure of strategic information management plans is described later9.413
Short-Term HIS Planning

Major task of short-term HIS planning is to establish an (annual) project list with recent
projects, priorities, and upcoming planned projects. This project list, also called the proj-
ect portfolio, has to be approved by the hospital management, which decides which
projects to execute and how to organize necessary resources. The project portfolio has to
match the (more general) priority lists described in the strategic information manage-
ment plan. However, its annual update reflects detailed prioritization and changes in the
environment.

Because of the temporal limited validity of the strategic information management
plan, HIS planning is a permanent task of strategic information management in
hospitals.
#256 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

9.4.2
Methods

9.4.21
Strategic Alignment

The role of information management varies between two extremes. At one extreme, infor-
mation management may be seen as a purely supporting function; that is, the hospital
strategy determines the information management planning activities. This is called “orga-
nizational pull.” At the other extreme, information management is seen as the strategic
resource, from which the hospital gains competitive advantage. The application of techno-
logical advances mainly determines the further development of the hospital and its posi-
tion on the health care market. This is called “technology push.” Strategic alignment
describes the process that balances and coordinates the hospital goals and the information
management strategies to get the best result for the hospital.

Several models exist for strategic alignment. The component alignment model
(CAM) of Martin et al. considers seven components — the external environment, emerg-
ing information technologies, organizational infrastructure, mission, ICT infrastruc-
ture, business strategy and ICT strategy — that should be continually assessed with
respect to their mutual alignment. Tan’s critical success factor (CSF) approach is a top-
down approach that firstidentifies factors critical to the hospital’s success or fail-
ure. Strategic information management planning is then derived with regard to these
factors.

Successful strategic alignment requires that hospital top management as well as infor-
mation managers have a basic knowledge of each other’s competence and share the same
conception of the role of information management.

9.4.2.2
Portfolio Management

An important instrument for information management strategic planning is portfolio man-
agement. Originally coming from the field of finance to acquire a well-balanced securities
portfolio, today the term portfolio management is used to refer to multiple strategic man-
agement problems.

Portfolio management concerning information management categorizes certain compo-
nents of an information system, like application components or physical data processing
systems, but also projects, using certain criteria to assess the value of these components for
the enterprise and to balance risks and returns. The assumption is that there are different
management issues and priorities for each class.

Project portfolio management categorizes projects, looking, for example, at project
objectives, costs, time lines, resources, risks, and other critical factors. McFarlan proposes
eight distinct project categories along the dimensions of project size, experience with the
technology, and project structure. Each category carries a different degree of risk, and thus
he recommends different project management tools to use. Today, project portfolio man-
agement is primarily used to plan and control IT investments.
#9.4 Strategic Planning 257

The portfolio proposed by the Gartner Group distinguishes three categories according
to the contribution of an application component to the hospital’s performance. Utility
applications are application components that are essential for the hospital’s operation, but
have no influence on the success of a hospital, and, therefore, are independent of the hos-
pital’s strategic goals. A good example is the patient administration system. Enhancement
applications are application components that improve the hospital’s performance, and,
therefore, contribute to the hospital's success (e.g., computer-based nursing management
and documentation system). Frontier applications are application components that influ-
ence the hospital’s position in the health care market, for example, the enforced use of
telemedicine. Information management planning should aim at a well-balanced applica-
tion portfolio — on the one hand, to efficiently support essential hospital functions, and on
the other hand, not to miss future technological innovations.

94.3
The Strategic Information Management Plan

An important aim of strategic HIS planning is to establish the strategic information man-
agement plan. The previous sections made clear that without a strategic information man-
agement plan, neither tactical nor operational management would work appropriately. A
strategic information management plan is an important precondition for systematic direct-
ing and monitoring the hospital information system.

The strategic information management plan should be written by the CIO and approved
by the hospital management. Without proper strategic planning, it would be a matter of
chance if a hospital information system fulfilled strategic information goals. But consider-
able efforts have to be made for creating strategic plans.

In this section, the goals and structure of strategic information management plans are
presented in more detail. Figure 9.9 presents an overall view on strategic information man-
agement planning.

9.43.1
Purpose of Strategic Information Management Plans

Different stakeholders? are involved in the creation, updating, approval, and use of strate-
gic plans. Such stakeholders may include:

top management;

employees, e.g., physicians, nurses, administrative staff;

clinical, administrative, service departments;

information management department;

funding institutions;

consultants;

hardware and software vendors.

The term stakeholder is used to refer to anyone who has direct or indirect influence on or interest
in a component of an information system.

Fig.9.9 Strategic information management planning of hospitals. A strategic information manage-
ment plan gives directives for the construction and development of a hospital information system.
It describes the recent and the intended hospital information system’s architecture. (Details are
explained in the following sections)

These stakeholders may have different expectations of a strategic plan and are involved in
different life-cycle phases for strategic plans:

e creation, i.e., writing a first plan;

approval, i.e., making some kind of contract among the stakeholders;

deployment, i.e., asserting that the plan is put into practice;

use, i.e., the involved stakeholders refer to the plan when needed;

updating when a new version is required (because of new requirements, new available
technologies, failure to achieve individual tasks, or just leaving the time frame of the
plan). After the first version, the creation and update phases merge into a cyclic, evolu-
tionary development of the plan.

The CIO and the information management department usually create and maintain propos-
als for the strategic information management plan. They are interested in clearly defined
requirements for their work, which is greatly concerned with tactical information manage-
ment issues. Top management is interested in the seamless and cost-effective operation of
#9.4 Strategic Planning 259

the hospital. Top management approves the plans (probably together with the funding
institutions). Representatives of the employees should be involved in eliciting the require-
ments, since they will use the resulting information systems. The current strategic plans
will be used by the information management departments and the vendors of HIS compo-
nents when constructing or maintaining components of hospital information systems.
External consultants may help to create plans, but also be engaged in negotiations for the
approval of the plans.

The most essential purpose is to improve a hospital information system so that it
can better contribute to the hospitals goals. This purpose should determine the struc-
ture of strategic plans; that is, it should show a path from the current situation to an
improved situation, in which the hospitals goals are achieved as far as possible and
reasonable.

9.43.2
Structure of Strategic Information Management Plans

A strategic information management plan should encompass the hospital’s business strat-
egy or strategic goals, the resulting information management goals, the current state of the
hospital information system, and an analysis of how well the current information system
fits the goals. The planned architecture should be derived as a conclusion of this
analysis.

The strategic plan also has to deal with the resources needed to realize the planned
architecture, and has to include rules for the operation of the resulting hospital information
system and a description of appropriate organizational structures. Examples of resources
are money, personnel, soft- and hardware, rooms for servers and (paper-based) archives,
and rooms for training. The resources should fit the architecture and vice versa.

The general structure of strategic information management plans in hospitals can be sum-
marized as follows:

e strategic goals of the hospital and of information management,

description of the current state of the hospital information system,

analysis and assessment of the current state of the hospital information system,
description of the planned state of the hospital information system, and

path from the current to the planned state.

This is only a basic structure that may be adapted to the specific requirements of individual
hospitals. Particularly, a short management summary and appendices describing the orga-
nizational structure, personnel resources, the building structure, etc. are likely to comple-
ment a strategic plan.

Strategic Goals of the Hospital and of Information Management

Based on a description of the hospital’s strategic goals (e.g., presented in a mission state-
ment), the strategic information management goals should be derived using the method of
#260 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

strategic alignment (see Sect. 9.4.2.1). Despite the imperative to individually derive infor-
mation management goals from the hospital’s strategic goals predefined catalogs of goals
may be helpful. One of these catalogs is provided by the information management stan-
dards of the Joint Commission in the USA (see Sect. 8.7.2).

Of course there will be goal conflicts eventually. They need to be taken into account and
resolved.

Description of the Current State of the Hospital Information System

Before any planning commences, the hospital information system’s current state should be
described. This may require some discipline, because some stakeholders may be more
interested in the planned (new) state than in the current (obsolete) state.

The description, i.e., a model of the current state is the basis for identifying those func-
tions of the hospital that are well supported, for example, by information and communi-
cation technology, and those functions that are not (yet) well supported. Thus, application
components as well as existing information and communication technology have to be
described, including how they contribute to the support of the hospital’s functions.

Hence the metamodel 3LGM? (see Sect. 5.3) and related software is very helpful for
this task.

Analysis and Assessment of the Current State of the Hospital Information System

The model of the current state has to be analyzed with respect to the achievement of infor-
mation management strategies. Note that missing computer support for a certain function
may not be assessed in all cases as being poor support for that function. For example, miss-
ing computers in patient rooms and consequently paper-based documentation of clinical
findings may be conforming more to a goal of being a humane hospital than the use of
computers and hand-held digital devices in this area.

Description of the Planned State of the Hospital Information System

Based on the analysis of the current state, a new state should be modeled that achieves
the goals better than the current state does, provided that the current state does not
already achieve the hospital's goals. Note that besides technical aspects, organizational
aspects also have to be discussed. The model of the planned state can thus be completed
by the description of the planned organizational structure of information management.
In many cases, this is an opportunity to introduce a CIO or to clarify his or her role.

Migration Path from the Current to the Planned State

This section should describe a step-by-step path from the current to the planned state. In
the strategic information management plan every such step is a project. Every project
#9.4 Strategic Planning 261

description should include assigned resources, that is, personnel, estimated investment
costs as well as future operating costs, etc., and concrete deadlines for partial results. The
resulting path of projects could also assign priorities to individual projects as well as
dependencies between projects.

This migration path is the basis for annual project portfolio preparation.

9.4.5.4
Establishing a Strategic Information Management Plan

Imagine you are the CIO of a hospital in which almost no computer-based tools are used.
One of the hospital’s goals is to support health care professionals in their daily tasks by
offering up-to-date patient information at their work-place.

‘Which main goals for information management would you define based on this infor-
mation? Which hospital functions should be supported by new computer-based informa-
tion processing tools?

94.6
Summary

Strategic information management deals with the hospital’s information processing as a
whole. It comprises planning of the HIS architecture and of the organization of informa-
tion management.

Tasks of strategic HIS planning include strategic alignment of business plans and infor-
mation management plans, long-term HIS planning, and short-term HIS planning. Strategic
alignment describes a process to balance and coordinate hospital goals and information
management strategies to get the best result for the hospital. The long-term planning of
HIS is defined in the strategic information management plan. Short-term strategic HIS
planning establishes an (annual) project portfolio.

A strategic information management plan is an important precondition for systematic
monitoring and directing of the hospital information system. A strategic information man-
agement plan should encompass the hospital’s business strategy or strategic goals, the
resulting information management strategies, the current state of the hospital information
system, and an analysis of how well the current information system fits the strategies. The
planned architecture should be derived as a conclusion of this analysis. Finally, the path
from the current to the planned state should be described.

The strategic information management plan should be written by the CIO and adopted
by the hospital management.Strategic Monitoring

After having planned the HIS strategically, one may expect the HIS will operate well in
most of its functions, with most of its information processing tools, and in many parts of
its operating organization. However, in many cases problems may occur. If we consider
the quality criteria as discussed in Chapter 8 problems like the following may arise:
Confidentiality of data may not be assured in some circumstances; transmission of reports
may not be timely; adequate data integration capabilities may not be provided and thus
consistency of redundant data may not be assured in a number of application components;
#264 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

since there is no data warehouse, the hospital may not be able to collect and analyze aggre-
gated data to support patient care and operations; the needs for knowledge-based informa-
tion in patient care may hardly be met, since easy access to current medical journals is not
provided. But there may be additional problems to be taken into account at a strategic level
such as, for example, users may be increasingly dissatisfied with an application compo-
nent, technical or motivational problems may lead to a decrease in documentation quality;
increased documentation time may limit the time available for direct patient care; there
may be unplanned high efforts for support and training; or the number of medical errors
may rise due to software errors or unusable software.

Besides low software quality, also badly organized projects in tactical information man-
agement or errors in strategic information management may lead to the described problems.

Problems may get visible very slowly, for example, when a formerly “good” HIS com-
ponent is not updated to match the overall technical progress, leading to more and more
inacceptable performance and functionality; or, when more and more new application
components have to be integrated into a spaghetti-styled architecture. But problems may
also arise very suddenly, for example when a server suddenly crashes, and no replacement
is available; or, when due to a software error, a wrong finding is presented to a patient, a
physician takes a wrong decision, and the patient is harmed.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:
e What are the typical tasks of strategic HIS monitoring?
® What are the typical methods of strategic HIS monitoring?

9.5.1
Tasks

As explained in Sect. 9.2.3, strategic monitoring means to continuously audit HIS quality,
to make sure it corresponds to the quality defined in its strategic information plan. The
management’s task is to install “sensors” to audit the information system’s quality. In
general, strategic management has to make sure that it regularly receives and analyzes HIS
quality information (permanent monitoring). In addition, information can be gained
through dedicated evaluation projects (ad-hoc monitoring).

Typically, both permanent monitoring activities as well as ad-hoc monitoring activities
are combined for strategic HIS monitoring. Both represent sub-types of an evaluation study.
Thus, both activities should be planned and executed as described in details in Sect. 8.6,
comprising the activities of study exploration, first study design, operationalization of meth-
ods and detailed study plan, execution of the study, and report and publication of the study.

9.5.1.1
Permanent Monitoring Activities

A hospital information system is too complex to allow monitoring all its components with
regard to all quality criteria as defined in Chapter 8. However, it is useful to define subsets
of criteria that should then be monitored on a regular (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) basis.
#9.5 Strategic Monitoring 265

Quantitative measurements for regular monitoring of the achievement of strategic goals are

also called key performance indicators. These indicators could comprise, for example:

e functional coverage of the application components (e.g., level of saturation of the over-
all HIS architecture, see Sect. 8.2.2, or percentage of documents primarily created in
computer-based form);

e user satisfaction (e.g., by regular user surveys);

e standardization of the HIS architecture (e.g., percentage of interfaces using standards
such as HL7);

e homogeneity of the HIS architecture (e.g., number of different application
components);

e availability of the application components (e.g., down times per year);

e performance of the application components (e.g., response time);

e costs for information management (e.g., overall costs, costs in relation to number of
users or number of workstations);

e quality of IT training (e.g., IT training hours per user);

e quality of IT support (e.g., number of hotline calls that are successfully solved
within 2 h);

o quality of tactical information management (e.g., percentage of successfully completed
IT projects).

To allow monitoring on a regular base, these key performance indicators should be
collected in quantitative and as far as possible in automated form. Reports should be pre-
sented to the information management board.

Besides monitoring those indicators, further permanent monitoring tasks may comprise
patient satisfaction surveys, medical error reports, or the local press containing comments
on the hospital’s HIS. In addition, national legislation (e.g., new data protection law) and
standardization initiatives (e.g., new version of HL7) should be monitored as both may
affect the HIS.

Sudden changes in monitored numbers can indicate problems (e.g., malfunctioning of
a component), which could then initiate more detailed analysis and corrections that are
then to be initiated by strategic directing.

Permanent monitoring activities can be used locally, but they can also be used to com-
pare HIS quality with other organizations or with established standards in the form of a
so-called benchmarking. Details on HIS benchmarking are explained later in Sect. 9.5.3.1.

9.5.1.2
Ad Hoc Monitoring Activities

Ad-hoc monitoring activities may be initiated when larger changes of a component are
planned, or when sudden larger problems of HIS components have been observed. Ad-hoc
activities help to analyze a certain situation in detail, in order to better understand reasons
and consequences of an observed or expected problem. The execution of those ad-hoc
activities entails systems evaluation studies which are planned and conducted by tactical
information management.
#266 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

Evaluation studies can focus on structure quality, process quality and quality of outcome

of a HIS component (see Sects. 8.2-8.4). For example, during the introduction of a nursing

documentation and management system, the effects on nursing care could be analyzed by

a sub-set of the following evaluation questions:

e How accurate and complete is nursing documentation after introduction of a computer-
based nursing documentation system?

e How are nurses satisfied with the new component?

e Is the offered functionality sufficient to support all steps of the nursing care
process?

e Js there any redundant functionality with other components?

o Did the introduction of the component affect the time that is available for direct patient
care?

® Does the quality of nursing care change?

e Did the level of data integration with regard to nursing data improve after the introduc-
tion of the component?

e How is the consistency of nursing data, comparing the new component and the remain-
ing paper-based patient chart?

e What did the purchase and introduction of the component cost?

® What do support and training of the component cost?

e Are there any unexpected negative effects on nursing care?

Typically, quantitative and qualitative methods (see Sect. 8.6 for details) can be combined
to answer study questions. Strategic HIS monitoring collects and reports the results, to
directly give feedback to strategic HIS planning.

9.5.1.3
Certification of HIS

Certification in general means to confirm that an object or organization has certain character-
istics. HIS certification in general describes a process where an accredited body confirms that
the HIS fulfills certain pre-defined quality characteristics. While approaches to assess the over-
all HIS quality are rare, there exist established certification systems for individual software
products (e.g., software for a medical documentation system) such as CCHIT and EuroRec
(for details on different approaches, see Sect. 9.5.3). Depending on the certification approach,
security, functionality or interoperability of the application component are assessed.

Many vendors try to obtain these certificates, as they hope to get an competitive advan-
tage. In fact, when buying software for a new application component, more and more
hospitals check for the availability of these certificates. In general, certification increases
transparency of different products and fosters buyers’ knowledge about products, as certi-
fication organizations often compile information about the different products and tech-
nologies. Increased transparency and knowledge in turn have a positive impact on the
buyers’ willingness to invest in new technology. Even when a HIS certification does not
guarantee that a HIS is good with regard to all and every criteria, certification may contrib-
ute to an increased quality of HIS in general.
#9.5 Strategic Monitoring 267

9.5.2
Methods

Details on planning and execution of evaluation studies as well as on general evaluation
methods have already been presented in Sect. 8.6. They form the basis for ad-hoc studies.
‘We will now concentrate on HIS benchmarking, as an approach for permanent monitoring
activities, as well as on HIS certification approaches.

9.5.2.1
HIS Benchmarking

Benchmarking in general describes a process in which organizations evaluate various
aspects of their performance and compare it to a given standard or to the best organizations
(“best-practice”). Typically, benchmarking comprises quantitative evaluation criteria such
as costs, quality of structures, quality of processes, or quality of outcome. In strategic hos-
pital management, benchmarking is seen as an important approach to assess a hospital’s
performance. Benchmarking is often seen part of a continuous quality improvement pro-
cess, in which organizations measure and then steadily improve their performance.

If a hospital wants to establish permanent monitoring activities on its HIS in the form
of a best-practice-benchmark, it needs to select standardized and clearly defined evaluation
criteria. Often, regional groups of hospitals join together on an ad-hoc basis to define and
compare their HIS benchmarking criteria. Besides, there are also international standards
for HIS benchmarking. For example, the criteria defined by COBIT (compare the example
9.5.3.2) or criteria derived from ITIL (Sect. 9.2.6) are used to benchmark especially the
quality of information management.

9.5.2.2
HIS Certification

Several approaches for the certification of hospitals and their HIS exist. For example, ISO
9001 standard’ assesses the hospital’s compliance with certain quality management stan-
dards. An ISO 9001 certificate states that an organization follows certain formalized business
processes, that it monitors the outcome of its processes, and that it facilitates their continuous
improvement; ISO 9001 focuses on the quality of processes. Another example is the Joint
Commission’s certification program; details of which have already been presented in
Sect. 8.7.2. So-called excellence programs, such as the EFQM Excellence Model“ in Europe
or the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the U.S. (for details, see Sect. 8.7.1) also
strive for quality improvement. They use a scoring system that makes it possible to compare
the performance of organizations to one another, and to continually observe improvement in

International Organization for Standardization. ISO 9001 standards on quality management,

“European Federation for Quality Management (EFQM) http://ww l.efqm.org
#268 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

quality of structures, quality of processes, or quality of outcome. Most of these certification
or excellence programs also comprise aspects on the quality of a HIS. For example, the
Baldrige program (see Sect. 8.7.1) and the Joint Commission standards (see Sect. 8.7.2) offer
specific health care information management criteria, to different extents.

There also exist certification approaches specific for hospital information systems. In
the USA, the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology (CCHIT)?
is developing quality criteria and a certification process for Electronic Health Records. In
Europe, the EuroRec Institute? is developing a repository of certification criteria to support
quality certification for Electronic Health Records. Finally, the THE initiative’ tries to
achieve interoperability between different clinical information systems based on existing
standards such as HL7 and DICOM. THE offers a standardized interoperability testing of
clinical application components of different vendors in so-called Connectathons that take
place in different parts of the world each year.

9.5.3
Examples

9.5.3.1
A HIS Benchmarking Report

The CIO of the Pltzberg Medical Center and Medical School (PMC) bi-annually reports
to the hospital’s management about the amount, quality, and costs of information process-
ing of Plétzberg’s hospital information system. For this report, the CIO uses HIS bench-
marking criteria that have been agreed to by a regional group of hospitals’ CIOs (see
Table 9.3). Each year, the hospitals exchange and discuss their reports as part of a best-
practice-benchmark.

9.5.3.2
COBIT

CobiT? is developed by the IT Governance Institute. It provides a common language for
executives to communicate goals, objectives and expected results of IT systems and IT
projects. COBIT is built on a process model that defines 34 IT-related processes within four
domains: plan and organize; acquire and implement; deliver and support; monitor and

specific process goals can be measured, what the key activities and major deliverables are,
and who is responsible for them. The following list presents an overview of the four domains
and selected, simplified key metrics (key performance indicators) for each of them.

Plan and Organize

This domain covers strategy and tactics, and concerns the identification of the way IT
can best contribute to the achievement of the business objectives. Selected key
metrics:

e percentage of strategic IT objectives that are aligned to the strategic hospital plan;

e percentage of redundant or duplicated data elements within the IT architecture;
e number of business processes that are not yet supported by IT;

e percentage of stakeholders that are satisfied with IT quality;

e percentage of IT projects that are on time and within budget.

Acquire and Implement

IT solutions need to be identified, developed or acquired, implemented and integrated into
the business process as well as maintained. Selected key metrics:

e percentage of users that are satisfied with the functionality of the new IT system;

e number of IT problems that lead to non-operation periods;

e percentages of IT systems that do not conform to the defined technical standards;

e percentage of IT systems where adequate user training is provided.

Deliver and Support

This domain is concerned with the actual delivery of required IT services, including man-
agement of security and continuity, service support for users, and management of data and
operational facilities. Selected key metrics:

e percentage of stakeholders that are satisfied with IT support;

e number of user complaints with regard to an IT service;

e percentage of satisfactory response times of an IT system;

e number of lost hours due to unplanned IT downtimes.

Monitor and Evaluate

All IT processes need to be regularly assessed over time for their quality and compliance
with control requirements. Selected key metrics:

CCHIT Functional Quality Criteria

CCHIT is a not-for-profit organization and offers certification for inpatient EHRs, ambu-
latory EHRs and other application components.'! The certification primarily covers func-
tionality, security, and interoperability, and is hierarchically structured in criteria and
sub-criteria. Table 9.4 shows some examples of functional criteria.'? Vendors are pro-
vided with a certification handbook and test-scripts for self-evaluation. The actual certi-
fication is then carried out by CCHIT auditors. The CCHIT certificate is typically valid
for 3 years.

Please look at the examples of COBIT key metrics presented in Sect. 9.5.3.2. Analyze how
they correspond to the quality criteria for structures, for processes, and for outcomes as
described in Chapter 8. To which quality criteria can they be matched?

9.5.4.3
Most Relevant Key Performance Indicators

In case you had to select the five most relevant indicators for HIS quality for your hospital:
‘Which would you select? You can look at examples in Sect. 8.7 and in Sect. 9.5.3 to get ideas.
How would you proceed to get regular information on your five most relevant indicators?

9.5.4.4
Organizing User Feedback

You are asked to organize regular user feedback facilities for the medical documentation sys-
tem of your hospital. How would you proceed? How would you gather user feedback? Which
user groups would you take into account? Which types of data (quantitative and/or qualitative)
would you collect? Which technical means would you use? Discuss different possibilities.

9.5.5
Summary

The task of strategic HIS monitoring is to continually audit the quality of the hospital
information system at strategic level. Monitoring can be done on a permanent base, but
also as dedicated ad-hoc monitoring activities.

Permanent monitoring activities comprise the definition of a subset of quantitative key
performance indicators that are to be automatically monitored on a regular (daily, weekly,
monthly, yearly) basis. Permanent monitoring is supported by national and international
certification, accreditation or excellence activities. Ad hoc monitoring activities are orga-
nized as regular evaluation studies.
#9.6 Strategic Directing 273Strategic Directing

Strategic directing of HIS is a consequence of planning and monitoring hospital functions,
HIS architectures, and information management organizations.

After reading this section, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What are the typical tasks of strategic HIS directing?

e What are the typical methods of strategic HIS directing?

9.6.1
Tasks

Strategic directing of information systems mainly transforms the strategic information
management plan into projects. These projects are taken from the strategic project portfo-
lio or the migration path as established in the strategic information management plan. The
decision to initiate projects is part of strategic information planning; the execution of this
decision is part of strategic information directing.

Planning, running, and (successfully) finishing projects are tasks of tactical information
management. However, strategic directing must initiate them and prepare an adequate
framework for them. In detail, the following main tasks can be identified:
® initiation of projects;
general resource allocation;
general time allocation;
general controlling of the project progress;
adoption of the project’s results.

9.6.2
Methods

For a project of important strategic relevance (e.g., introduction of a hospital-wide clinical

information system), a project management board will typically be established.

Such a project management board supports the project manager by providing an interface

between the project manager, future user groups, vendors involved in the project, and

strategic information management authorities like CIO and information management

board. Its tasks are:

e controlling the project with respect to allocated resources, allocated time and the
planned results,

o settling disputes and solving conflicts which may arise between project management,
vendors, involved hospital departments and strategic management authorities.

Typically, the project management board comprises representatives from strategic informa-
tion management authorities, from hospital management and from the hospital departments
and vendors involved. The project manager reports to this board and should be part of it.
#274 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

9.6.3
Example

9.6.3.1
Project Management Boards at PMC

Currently, two project management boards are established at Plotzberg Medical Center

and Medical School (PMC):

1. Project management board for the clinical information system. Head of the board is the
CIO. Members are representatives from the hospital board of managers (vice president for
nursing, vice president for administration), representatives from the main user groups
(senior physician from the surgery department, senior physician from the internal medi-
cine department), a representative of the software vendor, as well as the project manager.

2. Project management board for the introduction of a new computer-based intensive care
patient data management system. Head is the manager of the quality assurance depart-
ment. Members are the manager of the information management department, represen-
tatives from main user groups (senior physician and head nurse from the surgery
department), and the project manager.

9.6.4
Exercise

9.6.4.1
A Project Management Board at PMC

At the Pl6tzberg Medical Center and Medical School (PMC), a project is going to be initi-
ated to introduce a hospital-wide nursing documentation system. This application compo-
nent comprises functionality of comprehensive nursing data management as well as
supporting communication with other health care professionals.

Due to the high significance of nursing documentation, a project management board
will be installed. Who should the members of this board be? Explain your answer.

9.6.5
Summary

Strategic directing of information systems mainly consists of transforming the strategic
information management plan into projects. It is at least as important as strategic planning
and strategic monitoring, but often, from a methodological point of view, an immediate
consequence of them.

For projects of important strategic relevance (e.g., introduction of a hospital-wide elec-
tronic patient record system), a project management board typically is established. This
project management board serves as an interface between strategic and tactical informa-
tion management.
#9.8 Summarizing Examples 275Last But Not Least: Education!

For strategic information management in hospitals, well-educated specialists in health
informatics/medical informatics are needed. They should have appropriate knowledge and
skills to systematically manage such information systems, in order to appropriately and
responsibly apply information and communication technology to the complex information
processing environment of hospitals — and beyond (see, e.g., the next chapter).

Curricular national frameworks for educating such specialists are very important. In
this book and with respect to this importance, we want to refer to the recently updated
recommendations of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) on educa-
tion.!> These recommendations are designed to help in establishing courses, course tracks
or complete programs in biomedical and health informatics and to further develop existing
educational activities in the various nations. They also provide examples of how education
has been established within nations.

The IMIA recommendations by the way clearly and explicitly mention the relevance of
educating knowledge and skills in health information systems and its architectures and
strategies (see also the citations at the beginning of this book).

As education is not in the scope of this book, we only want to refer to the need to edu-
cate. The exclamation mark at the end of this section heading should help to highlight the
outstanding importance of education for professional and high-quality information
management.Summarizing Examples

9.8.1
Deficiencies in Information Management

The following letter was written by the head of the Department of Internal Medicine of the
Plétzberg Medical Center and Medical School (PMC) to the chief executive officer. He
complains about failures in information management.

Dear colleague,

I am sitting here again, having organized the duties for Good Friday and the whole Easter
weekend in a way that patient care as far as the physicians are concerned is guaranteed. I
can also be sure that nursing is well organized for these days, so [ want to use the holidays
to catch up with my work in the clinic. On the other hand, I have to realize that the network

of our clinic is down yet again and that consequently, starting from the door-keeper’s office
to every ward and every lab, there isn’t any kind of data processing or EDP support. The
door-keeper sends visitors coming to see their relatives to the wards by trusting their luck.
At the wards, essential information is missing and scientific work is delayed by the cutting
off of all internal and external scientific networks.

With this letter [ want to express my protest once again and complain about the fact that
the way information processing is managed in our hospital is completely unacceptable. [
do not know what still has to happen so that we can finally get an emergency service for
nights and for holidays. This is why I want to ask you to immediately make sure in the
board of the PMC and in the Committee for Information Processing that such a technical
standby service is installed for the maintenance of the network and for breakdowns in the
same way that we provide on-call services for all important clinical processes.

In summary, I want to express my deep disappointment about the whole situation.
Nowadays, information processing has gained such an important standing in daily patient
care that we can really put patients at risk if we do not immediately — and with this [ mean
at once — find a remedy for this problem.

Yours sincerely,

9.8.2
Computer Network Failures'

The computer system of Plétzberg Medical Center and Medical School (PMC) crashed
repeatedly over 3% days last week, periodically blocking access to patient records, pre-
scriptions, laboratory reports, and other information, and forcing the hospital to revert to
the paper-based systems of what one executive called “the hospital of the 1970s.”

Hospital executives said yesterday that patient safety was never jeopardized. But scores
of employees worked overtime printing records, double-checking doses, physically run-
ning messages from the labs to the wards and back — even rushing to buy copier paper on
the credit card of the chief operating officer (COO), Dr. E. The crisis, which lasted from
Wednesday afternoon until Sunday, took the hospital by surprise. Its electronic network
was named the nation’s best in health care last year by the magazine Information Week,
and its chief information officer (CIO), Dr. H., is an authority on medical computing.

As hospitals are urged to convert their record keeping to computers as part of the battle
against errors, hospital and public health officials are calling the incident a wake-up call
for hospitals across the country, whose computer systems may not be able to keep up with
their growing work load. At PMC, the systems handle 40 terabytes of information daily —
or 40 times the information in the Library of Congress.

"This example is based on a report in Boston Globe, November 19, 2002, page B1.

“Imagine if you built a house and you put in an extension cord to it, and then you hook
up a lawnmower, and then you hook up a barbecue. Eventually the breaker is going to
blow,” the CIO, Dr. H., said. “I as CIO feel a moral obligation to share the lessons we have
learned over the last few days with every other CIO in the country. Have you got systems
in place to deal with a problem like this? And if you have infrastructures that are at risk,
have you done due diligence to really look at your hospital and make changes?”

Although computer systems have allowed hospitals to work with more speed and flex-
ibility, executives said, last week’s events showed how frightening it can be when they fail.
“Any time you're taking care of very sick patients, when everything isn’t as you're used to
it, you get a little nervous,” said the COO, Dr. E.

The crisis began when a researcher installed software to analyze data, and a large
amount of information started flowing over the network. Doctors noticed intermittent
problems with e-mail and data entry. But at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, most of the systems —
from e-mail to accessing patient records to entering laboratory data — slowed or stopped
and stayed down for 2 h.

The hospital called in a special forces team of specialists from the manufacturer that
provides and maintains its computer networks. But the crashes kept happening every
4-6 h, so rather than go back and forth between paper and computer systems, the hospital
decided to switch to all-paper.

The emergency room shut down for most of Friday, and the hospital decided to refuse all
transfers except in life-threatening emergencies. Some lab tests that normally take 45 min
to complete took closer to 2 h, so doctors reverted to lower-tech methods of diagnosis.
“There was a sense of old-fashioned medicine,” said Dr. S., an intensive-care physician.

In response to the incident, the manufacturer plans to warn hospitals to update their
systems, the CIO said. He also plans to talk about the subject with the systems managers
of the state’s hospitals on Thursday, at a previously planned meeting of the regional Health
Data Consortium.

All hospitals were required to put in disaster plans. PMC had such a plan in place, but
because systems evolve so quickly, it was already outdated. The hospital has not calculated
how much the computer setbacks will cost. The COO said there may be some delay in
receiving payments from insurers because billing relies on the computer network.

Information Management Responsibilities’

The senior executives (chief executive officers, chief operating officers, or chief informa-
tion officers) at ten health care organizations conducted audits to evaluate the effectiveness
of information management in their own organizations. The organizations ranged from rural
hospitals to university affiliated teaching hospitals, with bed size ranging from 60 to 1,232.

'5This example is based on Austin KD, Hornberger JE, Shmerling JE, Managing information
resources: a study of ten healthcare organizations, J Healthc Manag 45(4);2000:229-238; discus-
sion 238-239.
#278 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

The audits evaluated how well the following seven information technology manage-
ment responsibilities were carried out: (1) strategic information systems planning;
(2) employment of a user focus in system development; (3) recruiting of competent IT
personnel; (4) information systems integration; (5) protection of information security and
confidentiality; (6) employment of effective project management in system development;
and (7) postimplementation evaluation of information systems.

The audit results suggest that most of these responsibilities are being met to a consider-
able extent by a majority of the organizations studied. However, substantial variation
across organizations was noted. Executives participating in the study were able to define
areas in which the management of information resources in their organizations was in need
of attention. The audit process encourages senior management to provide the leadership
required to ensure that information technology is used to maximum advantage.

Safely Implementing Health Information and Converging Technologies

From the Sentinel Event Alert from the Joint Commission, Issue 42, December 11, 20086:

“As health information technology (HIT) and “converging technologies” — the interrela-
tionship between medical devices and HIT — are increasingly adopted by healthcare institu-
tions, users must be mindful of the safety risks and preventable adverse events that these
implementations can create or perpetuate

There is a dearth of data on the incidence of adverse events directly caused by HIT overall.
The United States Pharmacopeia MEDMARX database includes 176,409 medication error
records for 2006 Of those medication error records, 43,372, or approximately 25 per-
cent, involved some aspect of computer technology as at least one cause of the error

Inadequate technology planning can result in poor product selection, a solution that does
not adapt well to the local clinical environment, or insufficient testing or training.
Inadequacies include failing to include front-line clinicians in the planning process, to
consider best practices, to consider the costs and resources needed for ongoing mainte-
nance, or to consult product safety reviews or alerts or the previous experience of others.
Implementing new clinical information systems can expose latent problems or flawed
processes with existing manual systems; these problems should be identified and resolved
before implementing the new system. Technology-related adverse events also happen when
healthcare providers and leaders do not carefully consider the impact technology can have
on care processes, workflow and safety.

If not carefully planned and integrated into workflow processes, new technology systems
can create new work, complicate workflow, or slow the speed at which clinicians carry out
clinical documentation and ordering processes. Learning to use new technologies takes
time and attention, sometimes placing strain on demanding schedules. The resulting
change to clinical practices and workflows can trigger uncertainty, resentment or other
emotions that can affect the worker’s ability to carry out complex physical and cognitive
tasks. Additionally, safety is compromised when healthcare information systems are not
integrated or updated consistently. Systems not properly integrated are prone to data

fragmentation because new data must be entered into more than one system. Multiple
networks can result in poor interoperability and increased costs. If data are not updated in
the various systems, records become outdated, incomplete or inconsistent.”

9.8.5
Increased Mortality After Implementation of a Computerized Physician Order Entry System”

The Department of Critical Care Medicine of the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine, Pennsylvania, USA, implemented a commercially sold computerized physician
order entry system (CPOE) in an effort to reduce medical errors and mortality. The research-
ers had the hypothesis that CPOE implementation results in reduced mortality among chil-
dren who are transported for specialized care. During an 18-month period, demographic,
clinical, and mortality data were collected of all children who were admitted via interfacil-
ity transport to the hospital. During this period, a commercially sold CPOE program was
implemented hospital-wide. The data were retrospectively analyzed comparing pre-CPOE
and post-CPOE period. The researchers found that, using univariate analysis, mortality rate
significantly increased from 2.80% (39 of 1394) before CPOE implementation to 6.57%
(36 of 548) after CPOE implementation. The authors argue that they found an unexpected
increase in mortality coincident with CPOE implementation. Reasons they discuss com-
prise increased time needed for documenting orders which interferes with the time-criticial
treatment of very ill patients, interruptions of communication processes between physi-
cians and nurses by the CPOE, and delayed administration of time-sensitive medication.Summarizing Exercises

e The ICT Department (see example 9.3.3.1) is distributed over several areas that are
some miles away from the hospital’s building. This causes long delays, loss of informa-
tion, and delayed response times in case of local problems.

e The costs of information management and information processing are unclear. For
example, the total costs of the introduction of an electronic mailing system for all staff
of the hospital are not exactly known.

e In the case of emergencies (e.g., fire) in the computing center, there may be extensive
data losses and a longer unavailability of important application components.

Summary

High quality HIS can only by achieved and HIS failures can only be prevented if HIS are
systematically planned, monitored and directed.

The tasks of information management in hospitals are planning, directing, and moni-
toring of HIS. It can be distinguished into strategic, tactical, and operational informa-
tion management. Strategic information management deals with the hospital’s
information processing as a whole. Tactical information management deals with par-
ticular enterprise functions or application components. Operational information man-
agement is responsible for operating the components of the hospital information
system.

Each hospital should have an adequate organization for strategic, tactical, and opera-
tional information management. In general, a chief information officer (CIO) should be
responsible for information management and a central information management depart-
ment. If there is decentralized information management staff, located at the individual
departments of the hospital, this staff has to be controlled by the CIO.

Consequently high quality HIS need not only adequate financial investments but also
considerable financial and human resources for their strategic, tactical, and operational
information management.

Strategic HIS planning deals with planning of HIS architecture and the organization of
information management. Tasks of strategic HIS planning are the strategic alignment of
business plans and information management plans, the long-term HIS planning, and the
short-term HIS planning. The main methods are the strategic alignment of hospital goals
and information management goals, adequate portfolio management, and the establish-
ment of a strategic information management plan.

Strategic HIS monitoring aims to continually audit the quality of the hospital informa-
tion system. It comprises permanent monitoring activities as well as ad hoc monitoring
activities such as dedicated evaluation studies.

Strategic HIS directing mainly consists of transforming the strategic information man-
agement plan into projects.

Summarizing, some quality criteria for an efficient information management can be
defined, such as:
® systematic strategic information management with a strategic information management

plan as the basis;
#282 9 Strategic Information Management in Hospitals

® systematic tactical information management, with clear management of the projects;

® systematic operational information management, with an appropriate support strategy
to guarantee the continuous and faultless operation of the information processing tools;

e clear decision structures, roles, and responsibilities for strategic, tactical, and opera-
tional information management,

o sufficient and ongoing training of the users;

e motivation and competence of IT staff, which is essential for the efficient functioning
of the information systems and for a high acceptance by the users.
#Strategic Information Management 1 0
in Health Care Networks

10.1
Introduction

In Chap. 7, we discussed specific architectural aspects that have to be considered in a trans-

institutional health information system, which is the information system of a health care

network. We will now examine how strategic information management works in such
networks.

Similar to information system architectures, principles of strategic information man-
agement in health care networks turn out to be similar to strategic information manage-
ment in hospitals. But since such a network is a group of legally separated health care
institutions, the managerial authority in health care networks can hardly be centralized in
one organizational unit. Thus, we are faced with polycentric or decentralized organiza-
tions, resulting in the following challenges:

e While members of health care networks remain legally autonomous, the mutual depend-
ency rises with increasing importance of the network.

e While members of health care networks have to cooperate in order to provide high-
quality and efficient care, they may compete in other sectors.

e While trust between health care network members is an important factor for the success
of the network, the economic risk rises with increasing dependency on cooperation
partners.

e While members of health care networks have to specialize in their core competencies
on the one hand, they need to align their transinstitutional care processes on the other
hand.

A consequence of these characteristics is that in health care networks each member fol-
lows its own strategy on the one hand but the network has to fulfill its goal on the other
hand. Typically no single person in charge, i.e., a CIO (see Sect. 9.3.1), exists in health
care networks. Hence, the typical (ideal) organizational structure of strategic information
management as presented in Sect. 9.3 cannot always be applied.

In this chapter, we can forbear from repeating the principles of strategic planning, mon-
itoring, and directing health information systems. But we have to supplement Sect. 9.3 by
examining additional organizational aspects of strategic information management when
legally separated institutions cooperate in networks.

#284 10 Strategic Information Management in Health Care Networks

In contrast to single institutions with hierarchical structures, such as hospitals, the inter-
ests of many legally autonomous actors have to be coordinated in health care networks.
After reading this chapter you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What are health care networks?

e How can health care networks be described?

e What organizational structures are appropriate for information management in health
care networks?

10.2
Description of Health Care Networks

In order to understand the challenges and possible information management mechanisms,
we need to be able to describe health care networks systematically. The attributes in
Table 10.1 can be used.

10.3
Organizational Structures of Information Management in Health Care Networks

Information management in health care networks is the sum of all planning, directing, and
monitoring activities with regard to the transinstitutional information system of the respective
network (see Sect. 9.2). In contrast to information management in hospitals, a multiplicity of
strategic interests exist in health care networks that may interfere with each other and have to
be coordinated with respect to the strategic goals of the network as a whole. This coordination
requires adequate organizational structures, which can be characterized by two dimensions:
centrality of information management and intensity of information management.

10.3.1
Centrality of Information Management in Health Care Networks

Centrality of information management describes how the competencies of information
management are shared among the network members. A high degree of centralization
means that few or only one network member is authorized to make decisions.

Regarding centrality, a continuum with two extremes can be identified: the complete
centralized information management and the complete decentralized information manage-
ment. Most of the real world examples are featuring characteristics of both extremes and
can therefore be termed hybrid management mechanisms.

In case of complete centralized information management, one member of a health care
network provides a strategic information management plan for the network and is in
charge of implementing the strategy. This is often the case when one member is a large

institution, such as a hospital and the other members are small, such as physicians in pri-

vate practices. Normally, the central member can provide many more resources for infor-
mation management. The interests of the members regarding the information management

strategy for the network are not coordinated systematically.
#286 10 Strategic Information Management in Health Care Networks

Complete decentralized information management is characterized by mutual coordina-
tion of interests among the network members. The information management strategy is
developed in a standardized process that is open to all members.

Both mechanisms possess advantages and disadvantages. The efficiency of decision
making is higher in the centralized information management. In contrast, coordinating the
interests of all network members in the decentralized mechanism can be a time- and
resource-consuming process. On the other hand, mutually agreed decisions have a better
chance to be accepted by all network members.

10.3.2
Intensity of Information Management in Health Care Networks

Intensity of information management describes the degree to which the decisions of infor-
mation management in health care networks are obligatory for the network members.
Remember that the membership in a health care network is voluntary.

In case of high intensity, the information management decisions have to be implemented
by the network members. This can be based on contracts and may be mandatory for the
network membership.

Low intensity means that the network members are not bound to implement the strategy
of the network information management. Here, the decisions can be understood as guide-
lines or recommendations.

Again, advantages and disadvantages can be identified. A higher degree of informa-
tion management intensity leads to increased reliability for the network members. If
the implementation of a certain communication standard or the purchase of a certain
application component is mandatory for all network members, the chance of improv-
ing efficiency and quality of transinstitutional information processing increases. In
case of low intensity, the individual member cannot rely on the decisions of the other
members.

On the other hand, a high degree of intensity leads to external dependencies that institu-
tions normally are trying to avoid. By investing in application components, communica-
tion interfaces, or infrastructure that supports the collaboration within the network, the
economic risk increases, since the investments may be useless once the network member-
ship has ended or the network dissolves. This is called “lock-in effect”.

10.4
Types of Health Care Networks

It turns out that the organizational structure of information management reflects the type of

collaboration in a network. Therefore health care networks can be characterized with

regard to their information management centrality and intensity. We can identify the fol-

lowing different types of health care networks (see Fig. 10.1):

e Loosely coupled networks show a low degree of centrality and intensity. They are
typically regional bordered, homogeneously configured, and are based on social
structures.

Fig. 10.1 Types of health care networks

e Hierarchy-like networks still fulfill the definition of health care networks, but decision
making in information management is highly centralized and the decisions made are
compulsory. Typically, these networks are configured heterogeneous and are dominated
by one large institution, such as a hospital.

® Balanced networks show medium degrees of centrality and intensity.

Example

10.5.1
Regional Health Information Organizations

One of the major approaches to reduce costs and increase efficiency in the US health care
system is focusing on so-called Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs). It
has been initiated by the US Department of Health and Human Services in 2004. RHIOs
are state-wide, local, or rural health care networks with a strong emphasis on the use of
#288 10 Strategic Information Management in Health Care Networks

computer-based application components in order to support transinstitutional care
processes.

The ultimate goal is to crosslink all RHIOs aiming at establishing a Nationwide Health
Information Network (NHIN). This process is in the lead of the National Coordinator for
Health Information Technology, a CIO with nationwide competencies. Typically, RHIOs
have to answer the following strategical questions:
® What are the appropriate architectures to achieve transinstitutional integration?
® Which standards should be implemented in order to ensure efficient transinstitutional

information processing and data protection?

e Which business models ensure sustainability of the RHIO?
e How can all stakeholders profit from the RHIO?

10.6
Exercise

10.6.1
The Plotzberg Health Care Network

In order to improve quality and efficiency of care for patients with chronic back pain, the
Plétzberg Medical Center wants to share medical data with regional general practitioners
and experts in private practices as well as rehabilitation centers.

The CIO of Plétzberg Medical Center and his experienced team decide to install a
portal-based solution to share information from the hospitals EHRs with cooperation part-
ners. A few weeks later, the application component has been introduced and is ready for
routine operation. In order to inform the doctors in private practices and rehabilitation
centers, a press conference is held. A few more weeks later, though, the CIO notices that
the portal is used only by two practitioners on an irregular basis.

Try to help the CIO of the Plotzberg Medical Center by answering the following
questions:

e How high is the degree of centrality in the Pl6tzberg Health Care Network?
e How high is the degree of intensity in the Pl6tzberg Health Care Network?

e What could be the reasons for the low acceptance of the introduced portal?

e What could be the approaches to raise the acceptance?

10.7
Summary

In contrast to information management in single institutions, such as a hospital, informa-
tion management in health care networks has to cope with additional problems that result
from the non-hierarchical organization of networks. Autonomy and dependency, coopera-
tion and competition, trust and risk between the members are coexisting in networks.
#10.7 Summary 289

In order to understand health care networks, we need to be able to describe them sys-
tematically. Important attributes are the network structure, the network management sys-
tem, the network care system, as well as temporal attributes of the health care network.

Transinstitutional information management in health care networks can furthermore be
characterized by the degree of centrality, i.e., the allocation of managerial authority and the
degree of intensity, i.e., the degree to which the decisions of information management in
health care networks are obligatory for the network members. Based on centrality and
intensity we can differentiate loosely coupled, balanced, and hierarchy-like networks.
##Final Remarks

Health information systems in general and hospital information systems in particular are
sometimes compared to large tankers crossing the oceans. Like tankers, these information
systems need careful and long-term planning (planning its course), they need continual
monitoring to ensure their course is still followed (staying on course), and they react only
very slowly to directing (steering) activities.

Well-educated specialists in health informatics/medical informatics (who are compa-
rable to tanker captains and officers), with the knowledge and skills to systematically man-
age and operate such information systems, are therefore needed to appropriately and
responsibly apply information and communication technology to the complex information
processing environment of health care settings.

For better understanding the role of “HIS tanker captains and officers”, another anal-
ogy in the context of hospital information systems, may be helpful. As mentioned, these
information systems have to evolve in parallel and in correspondence to the strategic
requirements of a hospital as a whole. The situation of the CIO in a hospital might be
regarded as comparable to the environment of the well-known engineer Scotty of “Starship
Enterprise,” who is always struggling to control the intricate complexities of his warp
drive engines in order to fulfill the whims of his captain in a usually insufficient
timeframe.

This book discussed health information systems, their architectures and the strategies
for information management. A specific focus was laid on hospital information systems.
As reader of this book, you should now be able to answer the following questions:
eo Why is systematic information processing in health care institutions important?

‘What do health information systems look like?

‘What are appropriate models and architectures for health information systems?
How can we assess the quality of health information systems?

How can we strategically manage health information systems?

And as a summary you may also have found the answer to the question “How can good
health information systems be made and maintained?” For us the answer is clear: “By
systematic information management!”

This book should be regarded as an introduction to this complex subject. For a deeper
understanding, you will need additional knowledge and, foremost, practice in this field.
