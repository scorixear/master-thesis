 ### 4.8.3 Strategic Monitoring Activities by Evaluation Projects
 An information system of a health care facility is typically too complex to allow all its components to be monitored at the same time.
 However, it is useful to define a subset of criteria to be monitored on a regular basis.
 Quantitative criteria can be better processed and compared.
 
 In general, monitoring comprises all activities that continuously audit and assesss a component of a health care facility.
 Auditing determines whether the information system is able to meet its tasks, i.e., whether it contributes significantly to the vision and mission of the health care facility, meets the stakeholders’ requirements (Sect. 1.​3), and fulfills the relevant laws.
 To allow auditing, monitoring needs to receive information from various sources, for example, on the successful initiation of projects from the strategic project portfolio, on the successful integration of an innovation in a health care facility, and on the quality of the information system.
 
 In this section, you will learn about the tasks of strategic monitoring, monitoring the strategic information management plan, and monitoring the results of monitoring.
 
 ### 4.8.4 Strategic Directing
 Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of auditing the quality of the information system and assessing the results of monitoring the quality of the information system.
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., system of concepts, into action.
 The system of concepts is a description of what the health care facility is able to provide for the customer, for example, in its role in the health care market.
 The system of action is a description of what the health care facility is able to provide for the patient.

Answer: "
Definieren Sie den Begriff „Krankenhausinformationssystem“.,"Deffine the term ""hosptial information sistems"".","
 “Hospital” is a noun or gerund (i.e., words often ending with -ing or -ion), and “information” is a verb. Therefore, the information is that the hospital is the source of the information.
 
 ### 5.8.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility should be of high quality.
 This is true for the quality of the information system as a whole, the quality of its management of information systems, and the quality of its information system.
 We will now discuss how we can assess the quality of the information system.
 
 ### 5.8.4 Quality at the Tactical Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility is composed of many different, yet interrelated components.
 In the previous section, we discussed the quality of the management of information systems.
 The outcome of high-quality management of information systems is, hopefully, a high-quality information system.
 We will now discuss how we can assess the quality of the information system.
 
 ### 5.8.5 Quality at the Operational Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility is in use.
 Thus, we can assess the quality of its operation.
 
 To assess the quality of the operation, we can assess the following aspects:
 - How smoothly the operation of the information system is.
 - How many different application systems are in use.
 - Which application system is the master application system (e.g., the one that contains the most important functions).
 - Which application system is the slave application system (e.g., the one that can be used by most of the users).
 - Which application system is the master application system for (e.g., the one that contains the most important functions).
 - Which application system is the slave application system for (e.g., the one that can be used by most of the users).
 
 The better the information system of a health care facility is managed, the better it will be able to meet the stakeholders’ needs.
 
 ### 5.8.6 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility is the basis for the functions","A Hospital Information system is the socio-technical subsystem of for hospitals. It comprimises all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.",1,single,IS_2022_07_18,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.
Question: Deffine the term ""hosptial information sistems"".
Answer: "
Was ist ein Modell?,What is a modle in the context of health information sistems?,"
 A model is a description of what the system of information processing of the health care facility looks like.
 
 There are at least two strategies for modeling health information systems.
 (1) All the information system’s information can be modeled with one --> application system. (2) There can be several --> application systems, and each one can hold and manage a partial --> information system.
 
 In the following section. 3.8.3, we will explain how and under which conditions the strategies above can be implemented in practice.
 
 ### 2.14.3 Information Logistics
 
 `Information and knowledge logistics aims at a system of information processing that is helpful for the patient in his different health care needs.`
 
 The concept of information and knowledge logistics can also be found in other management contexts.
 
 In the sciences, we usually distinguish between information and knowledge.
 We can, however, use the terms “information,” “knowledge,” and “information processing” interchangeably.
 We will now use a closer terminology and explain the different concepts of information, knowledge, and processing in health care settings.
 
 `An information system describes the --> information processing of a health care facility. It includes the facility’s mission, the resulting strategic goals, the current state of the information system, the future state of the information system, and the steps to transform the current into the planned information system.`
 
 The mission of a health care facility is to provide a patient-oriented health care.
 The resulting strategic goals of the health care facility are to offer the patient-oriented health care that the patient needs.
 The resulting strategic information management plan is the basis for the --> strategic information system of the health care facility.
 The resulting strategic information management plan is the basis for the --> strategic project portfolio of the health care facility.
 The portfolio is a collection of projects or groups of projects which the health care facility has to execute in the coming years in order to meet the strategic business goals.
 The portfolio thus contains the direction and strategy of information processing of the health care facility.
 
 The portfolio is the basis for the --> strategic project portfolio of the health care facility.
 The port",A model is a representatiuon of a system or process that is used to help understand and predict the behavor of the system or process. Health information systems models can be used to help design and evaluate health information systems. They can also beused to help identify areas for improvement in health information systems.,1,single,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

 ### 3.9.3 Information Systems in the Context of Research for Life
 ### 3.9.1 Medical Admission
 At the first contact with a patient, the physician will carry out the medical admission.
 This typically comprises recording the patients’ medical history (disease history, systems review, social history, past medical history, family history, medication). Administrative data are taken from the patient’s health record.
 The data are stored in such a way that they are always available for research projects.
 
 For example, during medical admission, the entity type “patient” may be used to carry out diagnostic admission.
 
 Medical admission is the basis for the treatment of a patient and is the precondition for documenting the nursing history.
 It includes recording the patients’ medical history (disease history, systems review, social history, past medical history, family history, medication). Administrative data are taken from the patient’s health record.
 
 ### 3.9.3 Management of Information Systems
 Information systems need systematic management.
 In general, management comprises all leadership activities that determine the goals of a setting.
 As a consequence of planning, monitoring, and directing a object, a person or a group of persons has or should have a role in the setting.
 We can consider management of information systems as a specialization of --> strategic management of information systems.
 
 In this section, you will first be given an introduction into various aspects of management of information systems.
 
 ### 3.9.4 Tactical Management of Information Systems
 Tactical management of information systems deals with specific components at the information system.
 It aims to introduce, remove, change, or maintain components of the information system.
 
 There are various aspects of tactical management of information systems.
 These are summarized in Table 3.​4.

Wie würden sie die PWE eines KIS gestalten?,How would they desing the phisical tool layer of a HIS?,"
 The medical history of a patient is the basis for the diagnosis and the treatment of a patient.
 The nursing history of a patient is the basis for the care planning of a patient.
 
 The medical and nursing histories are documented.
 The patient is left with plenty of questions, which can only be answered by the respective health care professionals.
 
 ### 3.11.3 Information-Processing Monitoring Activities by Health care Professionals
 After reading the previous sections, one may be left with the feeling that medical and nursing histories are the only important information-processing tasks of health care professionals.
 This, however, is not the case.
 Medical and nursing histories are only the basis for the diagnosis and the treatment of a patient.
 
 The treatment of a patient is a highly collaborative process.
 Not only are different facilities involved, but many different health care professionals with different tasks are also involved within the facilities.
 The patient is left with plenty of questions, which can only be answered by the respective health care professionals.
 
 ### 3.11.4.4 Arrange Appointments
 Either because of a self-made diagnosis or on the basis of a physician’s diagnosis and order, it may become necessary to visit a certain health care facility.
 This could be, for example, for a consultation with the family physician, a referral to the radiologist for a radiological examination, or a visit to a physiotherapist.
 We will now refer to these health care facilities.
 
 ### 3.11.5 Balance Functions
 The treatment of a patient is a highly collaborative process.
 Not only are different facilities involved, but many different health care professionals with different tasks are also involved within the facilities.
 The patient is left with plenty of questions, which can only be answered by the respective health care professionals.

 - In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of living.
 - In the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1950, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to an adequate standard of health.
 - In the International Classification of Diseases of 11.1, the right to health is found as part of the right of all people to a standard of diagnosis and treatment.
 
 The network of health care in a state or region consists, as already mentioned in Sect. 2.​6, not only of of its technological perspective but also of its organizational perspective.
 The global pandemic that broke out at the end of 2019 in particular highlights the importance of municipal health departments, national disease control authorities (e.g., the Robert Koch Institute in Germany), and international institutions (e.g., the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDS) in the United Kingdom). However, it also highlights the importance of networking among these authorities.

 ### 3.8.3 Logical Tool Layer
 At the logical tool layer, application systems or, in a broader sense, application components are the center of interest. As we saw in Sect. 3.8.1, application systems are not only used in one particular health care facility.
 Rather, they are often used in a variety of health care facilities.
 Therefore, technical complexity is higher and efforts with regard to data integration and interoperability are more demanding, as the user must be able to use multiple application systems for one task.
 
 In Sect. 3.8.4, we could see that many application systems are based on software from different vendors.
 Therefore, technical complexity is higher and efforts with regard to data integration and interoperability are more demanding, as the user must be able to use multiple application systems for one task.
 
 At the physical tool layer, heterogeneity and integration are more important.
 We could see that many application systems are implemented by different vendors.
 Therefore, technical complexity is higher and efforts with regard to data integration and interoperability are more demanding, as the user must be able to use multiple application systems for one task.
 
 ### 3.8.4 Logical Tool Layer

 The entity type “patient” represents a person who is the subject of health care.
 The entity type “medical admission” represents a medical admission.
 The entity type “nursing admission” represents a nursing admission.
 The entity type “transfer” represents a transfer to another organizational unit.
 The entity type “discharge” represents a discharge from a previous organizational unit.
 The entity type “transfer” is used in two different contexts.
 When a patient is discharged from a previous organizational unit and the related data is stored in the MDMS, these data on that entity type “transfer” are stored in the MDMS.
 In this example, the entity type “transfer” is the only one entity type that is stored in the database system of the MDMS.
 
 By contrast, the entity type “patient” represents a person who is the subject of health care.
 The entity type “medical admission” represents a medical admission.
 The entity type “nursing admission” represents a nursing admission.
 
 The entity type “transfer” is used in two different contexts.
 When a patient is discharged from a previous organizational unit and the related data is stored in the MDMS, these data on that entity type “transfer” are stored in the MDMS.
 In another context, the entity type “transfer” is used by the function “transfer to another organizational unit.”
 
 ### 3.11.3.4 Logical Tool Layer
 At the logical tool layer, the application systems are the center of interest.
 As we can see, the application systems are not only used in one place, but often in several.
 Therefore, technical complexity is higher and efforts with regard to integration and interoperability are more demanding, as the application systems are used in more than one health care facility.
 
 The patient administration system is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​2) for the entity types “patient” and “medical admission.” This indicates that the application system is the primary application system for these entity types.
 
 The MDMS is the primary application system (Sect","Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.
One entity type that is used and updated by this function is “patient.” The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on.",6,multi,Book,"Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM^2 classes.","Instruction: You are given a question and a context.

 Short-term advantages: The patient administration system, the MDMS, and the PDMS are able to receive and provide patient data on demand. This is particularly helpful if data is needed in more than one health care facility.
 
 Long-term advantages: In the resulting (AC^n, Vn) architecture, new application systems can be integrated, and application systems can be removed if they are not needed.
 
 Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used. For the exchange of clinical data, various communication standards can be chosen such as HL7 FHIR, DICOM, or CDA.
 
 ### 5.8.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system quality at the logical tool layer comprises the quality of application systems and the quality of their integration.
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of an application system:
 - The application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions. For example, an application system should be available by pagering. It should be stable and reliable, i.e., without unexpected downtimes. It should be performant to allow fast processing and the ability to present large amount of data (including images, videos, and text).
 - The application system should be secure, for example, following rules for data safety, data security, and electrical safety. It should be user-friendly, for example, allowing data entry via touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. In certain areas, it need be certified. For example, the PACS software is certified according to the national law for medical devices.

 User groups: I would organize regular survey of the following user groups: technical staff (e.g., lab, radiology), management staff (e.g., director, nursing manager), and—to some extent—economic staff (e.g., user-only for a limited time or a limited user group).
 
 Organization of user feedback: (1) Health information system users are randomly invited to an automatic short and standardized survey that is displayed during CIS login. (2) Every half year, I would organize sounding boards (e.g., 3–5) to discuss recent challenges with the CIS and opportunities for improvements.
 
 ### 5.5.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system of a health care facility is the socio-technical subsystem of the facility.
 As such, it comprises all information processing of the facility.
 
 The quality of the information system at the logical tool layer comprises the following aspects:
 - The right information: Is the information that the users need available? For example, can the physician access the lab results of a patient?
 - At the right time: Is the information available when it is needed (just-in-time)? For example, are the most recent lab results available before the patient’s appointment?
 - At the right place: Is the information available at the right place? For example, are the most recent lab results available at the patient’s bedside?
 - At the right people: Is the information available only to those who need it and who have the right to be there? For example, are the recent lab results only available to the treating health care professionals?
 - In the right form: Is the information available in a usable format? For example, can lab results also be displayed in a graphical way for a longer period of time?
 - In order to make the right decisions: Information should be used to inform decisions. For example, a graphical presentation of the lab results may show an increase in a lab value, which may in turn motivate the patient to change the administrated drug.
 
 The general user satisfaction with the health information system is the basis for the quality at the logical tool layer.
 
 ### 5.5","User groups: physicians, nurses, technical staff (e.g., lab, radiology), and management staff—these groups are typically large health information systems user groups.

Was ist IHE und welchen Nutzen hat es? Erläutern Sie den Zusammenhang zwischen IHE und Interoperabilitätsstandards.,What is IHE and what its benifits? Explain the relationship betwen IHE and interoparability standerds.,"
 IHE is an open standard specification which focuses on the standardized representation of clinical information in EHRs.
 It has been maintained by the IHE Foundation since the early 200s and supports semantic interoperability.
 
 IHE in general is not a standards body as such but fills a very important gap by selecting the three most relevant standards for a typical clinical workflow.
 Hinweis: IHE only selects standards which are not further refined by sub-standards
 
 In the following section, we will explain how and under which conditions the three standards can be used in the clinical workflow.
 
 ### 3.7.1 Health Level 7 Fast Health care Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR)
 HL7 FHIR (Fast Health care Interoperability Resources) is a recent HL7 standard based on the experience from other HL7 standards that was developed in and has been continuously updated since 2016.
 The focus is on sharing medical data in terms of transferring them from one application system to another in a standardized manner and thus make medical data portable.
 FHIR supports technical interoperability.
 
 The two basic building blocks are information models called “resources” which represent clinical, identifying, and financial information as well as APIs.
 The basic resources follow the so-called 80/800 approach, i.e., to meet 80000001’s needs by implementing 80002 rules.
 FHIR neither aims to cover all clinical information nor to provide an EHR but pragmatically focuseseseseseses on frequent, generic use cases.
 FHIR develops the FHIR specification and manages the resources, for which it also defines a number of rules on how to create them.
 
 FHIR provides terminology linking and validation.
 LOINC, for example, can be linked to the FHIR specification and used for validation.

 For example, ICD-11 is a very common integration profile for which the medical history of a patient is documented.
 ICD-11.​1 is another common integration profile for which the diagnosis and treatment of a patient are documented.
 ICD-11.​3 is a third-level, longitudinal integration profile for which the patient is monitored.
 
 ### 5.5.3 Ad hoc Monitoring Activities by Evaluation Projects
 Ad hoc monitoring activities may be initiated after larger changes of a component (e.g., a new application component) is introduced and the respective interfaces and - protocols are not well adapted to the component.
 This is reflected in the increased time needed to learn the component and the increased risk in overlooking or misinterpreting important patient information.
 
 Ad hoc monitoring activities help to analyze a certain situation in detail in order to better understand the reasons of an observed problem.
 These ad hoc activities are conducted in the form of evaluation studies that are planned and conducted in a dedicated way in order to obtain deeper insight into the situation.
 For example, during and after the introduction of a computer-based nursing management and documentation system (NMDS), its quality and its effects on the patient could be analyzed.
 Details on how to plan and conduct evaluation studies are discussed in Sect. 5.4.
 
 ### 5.5.4 Strategic Directing
 Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of planning the information systems and monitoring the results of its monitoring in the context of data warehousing.
 It aims at transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., to make it “real,” by initiation of projects.
 
 In the strategic information management plan, the projects to be initiated are taken from the annual project portfolio.
 The decision to initiate certain projects is documented.
 An application component is assigned to a project.
 Projects are unique undertakings that are characterized by objectives, by restrictions with regard to available time and resources, and by a specific project organization.

 ### 3.11.3 Logical Tool Layer
 #### 3.11.3.1 Interoperability of Application Systems
 An application system is an application system that is based on --> standards and can be used by several different user groups.
 
 The interoperability of an application system is the ability of the application system to exchange information with other application systems.
 Saying that two application systems are interoperable thus indicates that (1) they have interfaces and (2) they are—on the most minimal level of interoperability—basically able to send and receive data via these interfaces and (3) they are—on a more advanced level of interoperability—basically to be able to provide data to or receive data from other application systems.
 
 This is interoperability in its most minimal level.
 At the most advanced level of interoperability, application systems are able to provide or to invoke data from or to other application systems.

 After reading the previous sections, it may seem that strategic management of information systems must be a purely planned and monitored by the management of the health care facility.
 In this section, we will discuss the tools for strategic monitoring of the information system.
 
 ### 4.8.4 Strategic Directing
 Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of planning the business processes and the architecture of the information systems and the organization of management of information systems and the related structures.
 
 Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., system of concepts, into action, into a strategic information management plan.
 
 The system of concepts is the basis for the development of the strategic information management plan.
 The strategic plan contains the direction and strategy of strategic management of information systems and the architecture of the information system.
 
 The basis for the strategic information management plan is the mission of the health care facility.
 The mission describes what the basic functions of the health care facility are and what it stands for.
 For university medical centers in Germany, for example, it is stipulated by law that they must offer the basic functions of patient care, medical research, and teaching of",Trancations management ensures ACID properties during communication.

 ### 5.3.3 Quality at the Logical Tool Layer
 The information system quality at the logical tool layer comprises the quality of application systems, the quality of their integration, and the quality of their operation.
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of an application system:
 - Application systems should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - As clinical systems, application systems should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.
 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.

 - An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 - As clinical systems, application systems should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.
 
 The general architecture of the health information system should be sufficiently flexible to adapt to the changing needs of the health care facility.
 This means that the application system are to be used in a variety of different health care settings and for different user groups.
 For example, a system that is used by the management of information systems in one health care facility, may in the future be used in another health care facility.
 Therefore, the application system should be able to be used for several different purposes.
 
 In other words, a component should be able to provide its features for several different use cases.
 
 An application system should be reliable and provide defined services for a defined time under the given conditions.
 For example, an application system should be available by pagering.
 
 An application system should be user-friendly and support the usability of graphical user interfaces.

 An application system should be user-friendly and support the","Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",6,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

"Information systems managers can be partly compared to architects.
Read the following statement and discuss similarities and differences between information system architects and building architects [8]:

“We are architects.
[…] We have designed numerous buildings, used by many people.
[…] We know what users want.
We know their complaints: buildings that get in the way of the things they want to do.
[…] We also know the users’ joy of relaxing, working, learning, buying, manufacturing, and worshipping in buildings which were designed with love and care as well as function in mind.
[…] We are committed to the belief that buildings can help people to do their jobs or may impede them and that good buildings bring joy as well as efficiency.”","Informashun systems managers can be partly compared to architects.

 Health information managers can indeed be compared to architects.




 
 Health information managers design information systems that are used by various user groups.
 We can consider the management of information systems as that part of the overall management of a health care facility dealing with the strategic, tactical, and operational management of the information system.
 We must be aware that the information system serves the overall strategic goals of the health care facility.
 We must understand that the strategic goals of the health care facility are to provide a health care plan that is competitive to the best health care facilities in the health care network.
 We must be able to provide this plan to the patients and their relatives.
 We must understand that the patients and their relatives are the most important stakeholders of the health information system.
 We must also be aware that the management of information systems is an ongoing process.
 We must be able to handle several tasks of strategic, tactical, and operational management of the health information system with regard to the planned objectives.
 
 The objectives of the health care facility are to provide a health care plan that is competitive to the best health care facilities in the health care network.
 This plan describes how the patients and their relatives are to be provided with good health care when needed.
 This plan describes the processes of prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of the patients and their relatives.
 This plan describes the tools for data, information, and knowledge processing to be used.
 
 This is why this introductory chapter is on the strategic management of the health information system.
 
 After reading this chapter, you should be able to
 - describe the strategic goals of the health care facility,
 - describe the processes of strategic planning, strategic monitoring, and strategic directing of the health information system, and
 - describe the tools for strategic data, information, and knowledge processing to be used.

"A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospital has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.
Disease registers are research databases for collecting data about a specific disease, aiming for full coverage of the respective patient collective.
The aim of a knee endoprosthesis registry is to collect longitudinal data to find out which type of endoprosthesis works best over time.
The researcher wants to integrate data from patient-reported outcome questionnaires, findings from inpatient or outpatient visits at the hospital, and results from laboratory examinations.
Which entity types need to be integrated and from which application components do they come? Devise a plan how you would set up a sustainable research architecture, i.e., an architecture that also could be used in other research settings and for different disease or research entities, considering Sect. 6.6.","A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospitul has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.

 The following entity types have to be integrated: patient, person, diagnosis, finding, health record, medical procedure, patient record, self-gathered symptoms, material, medical device, classification, nomenclature.
 
 Application components to be integrated depend on local settings and implementation but will likely include: patient administration systems, MDMS, LIS, OMS, PDMS, and self-diagnosis systems (e.g., an app for collecting patient-reported outcome data) or patient portals.
 
 A research architecture for setting up multiple registries might include a DWS for research that is fed via ETL processes from the above-mentioned application components and can be tapped for data in different use cases or research scenarios.
 Finally, an open platform architecture would enable reuse of patient data in various research contexts.
 
 ### 6.12.3 Management Perspective
 Information systems in research settings are very different from those in patient care facilities.
 For this reason, we will discuss both the specific technological perspectives and the management perspectives in more detail below.
 
 The following specific technological perspectives must be taken into account by management of information systems:
 - The different types of application systems used in the various research settings (e.g., different application systems for different research purposes).
 - The different types of data that are to be processed in the various research settings (e.g., clinical data, identifying data, and text data).
 - The different types of integrity and interoperability at the physical tool layer (e.g., different types of integrity and interoperability at the physical tool layer).
 
 The following management perspectives must be taken into account by management of information systems:
 - Strategic alignment of the vision, mission, and strategy of the health care facility with the strategic information management plan.
 - An information-processing function should be established that is responsible for the strategic management of the information system and the related budget.
 - An information-processing board (e.g., a --> strategic information management board) should be established to make strategic decisions on the information system.
 - An information-processing portfolio should be established that describes --> projects or groups of projects and their priority, and a rough","The following entity types have to be integrated: patient, person, diagnosis, finding, health record, medical procedure, patient record, self-gathered symptoms, material, medical device, classification, nomenclature.
