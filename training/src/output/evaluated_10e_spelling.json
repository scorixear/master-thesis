However, they also contain complex genetic tools from sequencing, also called “omics” data. Each of the three tools that are used in the study (e.g., LIS, OMS, and Ploetzberg Hospital) are discussed in more detail in the following sections.\n \n ### 3.11.2 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported\n In Sect. 3.8, we introduced the data typical for health care settings and described the functions of health care settings.\n Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these functions are processed in health care settings.\n As explained in Sect. 2.8, we use information-processing functions—or short: functions) as sets of cooperating application systems.\n \n You will remember that functions can be structured into a hierarchy of functions, where a function can be described in more detail by refined subfunctions.\n For example, nursing admission can be seen as a subfunction of patient admission. A function can be either supported by one application component or by a set of combined (“orchestrated”) application components.\n In health care, the interoperability standards openEHR (FHIR) and open SNOMED CT are well-known for the implementation of this function (Sects. 3.72.8 and 3.72221).\n Communication of data between application systems is classified into three categories, A, B, and C, according to their interface type (“if-type”). Sources of Type A are designed using IHE profiles.\n There are application systems that can serve HL7 and DICOM standards but do not fully implement IHE profile.\n They are referred to here as Type B sources.\n Type C sources are proprietary, such as data provided by comma-separated value (CSV) files.\n \n The “Data Integration Engine” executes data transformation and load processes from sources into a health care facility.",

Therefore, the OMS should be closely connected to the MDMS.\n \n A vast amount of data must be documented during each operation, including the members of the operating team, the operative procedure, the date and time, duration of the operation, materials (e.g., implants) that were used, and other necessary data to describe the operation and its results.\n Surgeonsics need a lot of data for billing purposes, and operation data form the backbone of billing data.\n The OMS should therefore also provide supportive features for anesthesiologists and billing staff by providing reminder for fulfilling of legal reporting requirements.\n \n ### 2.16.9 Patient Data Management Systems (PDMS)\n Patients in critical situations are treated in intensive care units (ICU). These patients are generally in an unstable state and within seconds may enter into a life-endangering situation.\n Thus, the detailed and complete presentation of all relevant patient data specifications (e.g., vital signs, orders, results, decisions) is required for a successful therapy.\n This is only possible when automated monitoring devices continuously measure and record various patient data.\n In addition, parameters that could point",
