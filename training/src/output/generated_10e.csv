Wie erhalten Apotheker:innen Zugriff auf verordnete eRezepte?,How do pharmacists get access to e-prescriptions?,"
 - The CPOE system provides a list of available radiology examinations.
 - The CPOE system can therefore be used as an MDMS, NDMS, or CPOE system.
 - - In the case of medication errors, the CPOE system can be used to alert the physicians about potential problems associated with a given prescription.
 - The CPOE system may also be used to improve medication habits, for example, by providing automatic alerts to perform an activity, for example, taking medication.
 - The CPOE system may also be used to improve the coordination of patient treatment.
 - In particular, the CPOE system may be used to ensure the availability of data for decision-makers in real time, for example, during patient admission.
 - The CPOE system may also be used to ensure the availability of data for medical research facilities to support continuity of care (e.g., can hospital, nursing home, and CPOE system access relevant information on given patient treated by all three facilities?)
 - The CPOE system may be used for decision-making in general, for example, when a patient is being treated by all three facilities are involved in a health care process and the patient is being treated by each of the facilities.
 - The CPOE system may also be used for operational management of information systems, for example, to define and enforce rules for operating the components of the information system.
 
 ### 3.4.9 Patient Data Management Systems (PDMS)
 Patients in critical situations are treated in intensive care units (ICU). These patients are generally in an unstable state and within seconds may enter into a life-endangering situation.
 Thus, the detailed and complete presentation of all relevant patient data is required for a successful therapy.
 This is only possible when automated monitoring devices continuously measure and record various patient data.
 In addition, parameters that could point to the initial deterioration of the patient’s health status should be automatically detected and should lead to an immediate alert of the treating health care professionals.
 Functions being performed in ICU are outlined in Table 3.9.

 ### 3.9.2 CityCare
 The following questions can be answered by reading the text and analyzing the 3LGM^2 figures of the CityCare Example 3.11. (a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems? Which functions (domain layer) that are added at the domain layer that that that are well supported by these application systems could be added at the domain layer of CityCare?
 (b) In which database systems shown in the logical tool layer should the entity type “patient” be stored?
 (c) The MPI should receive messages containing PINs (entity type “patient”) from all patient administration systems. Why is there no communication link between the MPI and the patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, for example?
 (d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?
 (e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if “Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital” fails? Suggest the introduction of a better application server that also fails in case a single function is performed.
 (f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.
 
 Answer:
 (a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added as a function added at the domain layer. It would be supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also supported by the EHRS.

 ### 3.7.2 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported
 In the last section, we introduced the data typical for health care settings and described the data by entity types.
 Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these entity types are processed in health care settings.
 As explained in Sect. 2.8, we can use information-processing functions—or short: functions) as application components or services in health care settings.
 
 You will remember that functions use and update certain entity types.
 The used data is updated, which often results in data on other entity types.
 In this section, we will present a selection of functions typical for health care settings and will explain which entity types are used and which are updated.
 However, we will not (yet) consider how they are supported by different data, information, and knowledge processing tools.
 This will be done in Sect. 3.4 and the following sections.
 
 In this section, you will learn about the most important functions to be performed by patients, informal caregivers, health care professionals, and management and administrative staff in health care settings.
 You will also learn about data that are used or updated by these functions.
 
 To illustrate which entity types a particular function uses and which it updates, we will use diagrams corresponding to those we also used in Sect. 2.14.1. Please read there again what the symbols mean.

 The dynamic view of information systems consists of the activities to be done, their chronological and logical order, the conditions under which they are performed, and the links to roles, organizational units, or logical or physical tools for data and information processing.
 The dynamic view contrasts with a static view of information systems, which means focusing on a single item or on a single role when considering the information system’s dynamic view.
 
 The role of the patient, the function patient admission, and the application components that are used in a hospital are modeled in the scenario.
 The health care facility can be considered as a hospital-based health care facility where patients with acute and chronic diseases or in an emergency situation receive inpatient and, if necessary, outpatient treatment.
 The hospital-based health care facility has its own patient administration system, MDMS, CPOE system, and the application components offering features for decision support and various statistical analyses.
 The hospital also features a kitchen/canteenen, administration of patient data, and social services.

Answer: "
Welche Speichermedien gewährleisten eine Unveränderbarkeit der Daten?,Which storage media guarantee that the data cannot be changed?,"
 The storage of data in a hospital can be described by several characteristics: - Data consistency is maintained by the application components of the hospital (e.g., through the occurrence of an event called “admission”).
 - Data integration is maintained in a coherent and uniform way (e.g., through the occurrence of an event called “admission”).
 - Data warehouse systems (DWSMS) provide correct, complete, and up-to-date patient information in an institutional setting.

 The hospital can be considered as a university medical center where the application system is used via a central database.
 The application system of the hospital, where the order was made, sends back the message via a communication server to the application system of the health care network.
 
 ### 3.9.2 Domain Layer: Interoperability and Standards
 As we saw in the previous section, health information systems are characterized by containing many application systems, i.e., they are usually of the AC^n architecture type.
 And we saw that these application systems can only guarantee data integrity in their health information systems if the application systems communicate with each other.
 Even more, this communication is the absolute prerequisite for the health care professionals to make the right decisions.
 The application systems need to be able to communicate, for example, about diseases, about possible diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and their risks, or about positive or negative aspects of medication.
 The health care professionals need to be able to access all relevant patient data specific to a situation in addition to general medical and nursing knowledge (e.g., guidelines, recent study results and standards).
 The domain layer describes the application systems’ interoperability with each other as well as the quality of the information systems’ integration (e.g., data integration, semantic integration, user interface integration).
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of the information system at a domain layer: - Data integration (e.g., Data integration is maintained in a correct, complete, and uniform way),
 - Data consistency (e.g., Data consistency is maintained in a correct, complete, and uniform way),
 - Data integration (e.g., data integration is maintained in a correct, complete, and uniform way),

Answer: "
Wie erfolgt die Kommunikation der Anforderung (order) an das LIS?,How is the request (order) communicated to the LIS?,"
 The request was made by the ordering unit of the hospital.
 It is nowhere in the LIS.
 
 ### 3.9.2 Supply and Disposal Management, Scheduling, and Resource Allocation
 The health care facility must offer sufficient and well-organized resources for patient care.
 This is true for wards (ward management) as well as outpatient units (outpatient management). Efficient process organization is extremely important, for example, in outpatient units or outpatient units, and can be supported, for example, by providing working lists for individual staff members by issuing reminders about appointments or by visualizing actual process flow.
 The facility’s information system must be able to support communication of all involved units and facilities involved in patient care.
 This comprises, for example, synchronous (e.g., telephone) and asynchronous (e.g., blackboards, brochures, email) communication.
 Staff members must be able to be contacted within a prescribed period of time.
 
 **Supply and Disposal Management**
 Supply and disposal of materials, food, drugs, and so on must be guaranteed.
 - Catering
 - Material and medication management
 - Laundry management
 - Management of medical devices
 - Scheduling and resource allocation
 
 **Human Resources Management**
 - This contains all tasks for the development and improvement of the productivity of staff.
 - It comprises, for example, staff and position planning, the staff register, staff scheduling, and staff payroll.
 - administration of human resource master data,
 - human resource planning,
 - work organization and time management,
 - payroll accounting,
 - administration of business trips and further training.
 - performance of legal notification requirements, for example, data on quality of life.
 
 #### Reference Management of Information Systems (RMIS)

Question: Which application system is usually used to display a laboratory finding in the University Hospital?
Answer: "
Wie würden sie die PWE eines KIS gestalten?,How would they design the physical tool layer of a HIS?,"
 The CPOE system is connected to a patient terminal, a PC and a tablet PC.
 The application system also features a graphical presentation of tools layer with a graphical presentation of tools layer.
 The graphical presentation of tools layer shows which functions are well supported by which application component and which physical data processing tools are used.
 The graphical presentation also helps to identify the evaluation questions that are most crucial for given situation.
 In other words: Depending on the problems or goals of the health care facility, only specific evaluation questions are of relevance and make sense.
 For example, imagine that a health care facility has introduced a CPOE system for medication ordering with the aim to increase efficiency and quality of prescriptions.
 - In the case of larger health care facilities, the application components that are relevant for the functions are more likely to be closely connected by bidirectional communication links.
 - As the most widely implemented and well-established application components, HL7 V2 messages and DICOM will be used as examples of this (Sects. 3.7.2.4 and 3.7.2.6). However, there are more.
 HL7 CDA is a standard for structuring medical documents and contributes to syntactic interoperability.
 HL7 FHIR is a standard for structuring open-ended documents and contributes to semantic interoperability.
 open-ended documents are more common than ever before in health care facilities and will therefore be used more frequently in the future.
 
 The open-ended nature of data capture allows the storage and reuse of patient data in different contexts.
 The open-ended nature also facilitates the cross-institutional identification of patients (Sect. 3.8.1) and may provide information on the most relevant evaluation questions given the context (Sect. 3.7.2).
 
 Systems can be considered as combining an application system with a non-computer-based application component in such a way that the resulting information system—as opposed to its parts—displays a new quality.

 The function “patient admission” is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system, which is used by administrative patients when they are first admitted to a hospital. The function “medical admission” is supported by the MDMS.

 The function “medical history” is supported by the MD","(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.
(b) The entity type ""patient"" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type ""patient,"" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.
(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.
(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
Pros (examples):
- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

Cons (examples):
- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.

Resolving these redundancies (examples):
- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).

The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
 
(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems.

 User groups: physicians, nurses, technical staff (e.g., lab, radiology), and management staff—these groups are typically large health information facilities user groups. I would also organize regular survey of CIS key users, as they are experts in judging the quality of information systems.
 
 Organization of user feedback: (1) Health information system users are randomly invited to an automatic short and standardized survey that is displayed during CIS login.
 (2) Every half year, I would organize sounding boards (a structured approach to obtain active feedback from stakeholders) with key users and with representatives from the larger user groups to discuss recent challenges with the CIS and opportunities for improvements.

 - A physician enters a medical diagnosis for a patient first in the medical documentation and management system (MDMS) and later, when ordering an X-ray, again in the CPOE system.
 - The position of the patient’s name and the formatting of the patient’s birthdate vary between the MDMS and the CPOE system.
 - When physicians shift from the MDMS to the CPOE system, they have to log in again and again, even when using the same application system.
 - Context is maintained when the application systems are used by different user groups, which is quite common in health information systems. A task that is used in many health care facilities is to be performed by different groups of health care professionals in different facilities.
 - Feature: Functionality offered by the application software product of the --> application system which directly contributes to the fulfillment of one or more --> functions (Sect. 2.​9).
 - Feature integration: Condition of an --> information system in which --> features needed in more than one --> application system are implemented only once, for example, as --> services, and can be invoked by other application systems (Sect. 3.​8.​5).
 - Function: Short for --> information processing function (Sect. ","User groups: physicians, nurses, technical staff (e.g., lab, radiology), and management staff—these groups are typically large health information systems user groups. I would also organize regular survey of CIS key users, as they are experts in judging the quality of the information systems.

Organization of user feedback: (1) Health information system users are randomly invited to an automatic short and standardized survey that is displayed during CIS login.
(2) Every half year, I would organize sounding boards (a structured approach to obtain active feedback from stakeholders) with key users and with representatives from the larger user groups to discuss recent challenges with the CIS and opportunities for improvements.",2,multi,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

 The Clinical history must be made available for other functions by including it with the patient’s health record.
 However, some facilities only have access to patient-related documents and data that originated from the same facility, i.e., the facility’s patient record.
 
 The patient record may be electronic or notebooked but must be able to print out data on demand.
 
 The patient record archive must be able to manage patient records and make them available upon request within a defined time frame.
 The exact location of each record should be known (e.g., in which archive, on which shelf). The health record must be able to be accessed by other functions with the right to see which facility-related data was added, deleted, or changed.
 
 ### 3.4.11 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported
 In Sect. 3.3, we introduced the data to be processed and provided.
 Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these entity types are processed in health care facilities.
 As explained in Sect. 2.8, we can use information-processing functions—or short: functions) as application components or services in health care facilities.
 
 You will remember that functions use and update certain entity types.
 The used data is updated, which often results in data on other entity types.
 In this section, we will present a selection of functions that are performed in health care facilities.
 These functions include, for example, ordering a radiological examination and providing a report or providing a document for use outside one’s own facility and then using the document from outside.
 We will also discuss how they are supported by single application components and how they are supported by single application components.

"Was sind System, soziotechnisches System",What are system and socio-technical system?,"
 A system is a set of persons, things, events, and their relationships forming an integrated whole. A system can be divided into subsystems that comprise a subset of the components and the relationships between them.
 For example, the sympathetic nervous system is a subsystem of the nervous system. A subsystem of a hospital, for example, is ward with its staff and patients.
 Subsystems themselves are again systems.
 
 A system can be divided into super-ordinate systems that comprise a subset of the components and the relationships between them.
 For example, the sympathetic nervous system can be seen as a disorder of the endocrine system. A disorder of the endocrine system itself is an event of the endocrine system.
 
 A system can be divided into service-oriented components that provide encapsulated features (“services”) that can be used by other application systems. A service is an encapsulated feature that can be used by other application systems (e.g., “discharge letter” or “patient”). A service can be both provided by one application system and by several application system (multicasting).
 
 The patient administration system, for example, can be used as a service-oriented component providing a unique patient identification number (PIN) in an institutional information system and even in --> transinstitutional information systems with several patient administration systems (multicasting).
 
 A service-oriented architecture (SOA) with many different application systems can be used to provide more complex services to be used by other application systems than in the case of a monolithic (AC1, V1, Vn, V1, V2, V3) architecture.
 Communication with other application systems can be done in different ways, each achieving specific qualities of the information system’s architecture.
 The patient administration system, for example, can communicate with other application systems by sending Mr. Russo’s administrative patient data there.
 If the RIS can thus obtain confirmation on the location of Mr. Russo’s administrative patient data in its database, it can send a message on this data to other application systems.
 
 A message is a set of data on entities (e.g., administrative patient data, a given patient’","A system is a set of persons, things, events, and their relationships forming an integrated whole.

Answer: "
Bitte skizzieren Sie eine typische LWE,Describe the logical tool layer.,"
 The logical tool layer of a 3LGM^2 model describes the application components of a health care setting and the communication tools for data exchange.
 The layer is independent of the implemented physical and logical tools for data exchange.
 
 ### 2.14.2 Domain Layer: Interoperability and Standards
 As we saw in the previous section, health information systems are characterized by containing many application systems, i.e., they are usually of the AC^n architecture type.
 And we saw that these application systems can only guarantee data integrity in their health information systems if the application systems communicate with each other.
 Even more, this communication is the absolute prerequisite for the health information system to fulfill its task of ensuring the necessary data and knowledge logistics.
 
 Thus, application systems need to be able to communicate—they need to be interoperable.
 Without interoperability, no meaningful integration of application systems within health information systems is possible.
 Integration means that the application systems are put together in such a way that the information system—as opposed to its parts—displays a new quality.
 There are various kinds and aspects of integration, as we will discuss later in Sect. 3.8.
 
 Interoperability in general is the ability of two application systems to exchange information with each other and thus to be able to exchange information with other application systems as well.
 Aspects of interoperability comprise the following aspects: - the ability of two application systems to exchange information via each other,
 - the availability of data in both application systems,
 - the availability of content in both application systems,
 - the availability of features in both application systems,
 - the availability of processes in both application systems,
 - the availability of tools for data, information, and knowledge processing in both application systems, and
 - the availability of tools for data, information, and knowledge processing in other health care facilities (e.g., can hospital, nursing home, and general practitioner (GP) access relevant information on given patient treated by other application systems?)
 - the availability of tools for data, information, and knowledge processing in general (e.g., can access relevant information on given patient treated by other application systems?)
 - the availability","Consists of Application Systems, or in broader sense, application component as the center of interest.

Question: Describe the logical tool layer.
Answer: "
"Bitte erläutern Sie die Begriffe Integration, Interoperabilität, Integrität.","Please explain the terms integration, interoperability, integrity.","
 Data integration would be considered high when the data are not only used in one application system but in several application system.
 Consequently, in a health information system where data integration is given, data can be used and updated in one place and thus in one application component.
 
 Semantic integration would be considered high when the application systems actually use the same system of concepts, i.e., they interpret data the same way.
 For example, when the sending application system uses the abbreviation “GOT” for a lab value, but the receiving application system does not know this code and uses “ASAT” for the same concept, then semantic integration is not achieved.
 
 User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
 For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients’ hometown are displayed in the same place on the user interface.
 Icons for patients are displayed in the same way.
 Alerts and warnings are presented using the same colors.
 Or the birthdate of patients is displayed in the same format (e.g., yyyy-mm-dd).
 
 Context integration would be considered high if both application systems are able to exchange and jointly use patient diagnosis data.
 The nurse shifts from one application system to the other, and thus supports semantic interoperability.
 The nurse also supports user interface integration (e.g., usability is very usable in both application systems) (Sect. 5.​4).
 
 Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.
 
 Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that process interoperability is supported in an efficient way.

 HIS standards for health information systems are composed of standards for the respective health care facility’s departments, for example, the standards for internal processes, the standards for external processes, the standards for data privacy, the standards for data security, the standards for data interoperability, and the standards for data integration.
 For the exchange of bio-signals and vital signs between point-of-care devices, the ISO/IEEE 11073 standard is available.
 openEHR focuses on the representation of clinical information in detailed clinical models and allows for the creation of a semantically fully defined EHR.
 SNOMED CT is used for the representation of clinical research (trial) data and metadata and provides detailed descriptions to the clinical trial planning data and metadata, being widely used in electronic data capture (EDC) systems.
 
 We can now discuss some of these standards in more detail.
 The list is by no means complete, with new standards emerging and others disappearing frequently, as well as current ones changing.
 
 #### Reference Identifiers Names and Codes (RINC)
 The Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Consortium (CDASC) spans a wide variety of standards, which are mainly—but not exclusively—designed for and has been used in many studies and trials in the pharmaceutical industry.
 CDASC standards were developed in the late 1990s and are maintained by the non-profit Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Consortium.

 For example, the processes to define and compare benchmarking criteria are different between HL7 and DICOM.
 
 ### 4.9.2 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported
 In Sect. 3.8, we introduced the data typical for health care settings and described the functions of health care settings.
 Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these functions are processed in health care settings.
 As explained in Sect. 2.8, we use information-processing functions—or short: functions) as sets of cooperating application systems showing how to use communication standards in typical health care settings.
 
 You will remember that functions can be supported by one or more application systems in a health care setting.
 The function “execution of diagnostic procedures,” for example, can be supported by one or more application systems in a health care setting.
 We call these application systems “domain layer.”
 
 `A domain layer describes functions or application components that are similar or very similar in certain characteristics.`
 
 The function execution of diagnostic procedures can be supported by one or more application components in a health care setting.
 The function execution of diagnostic procedures itself can be supported by one or more application components in a health care setting.
 
 The function “execution of diagnostic procedures” is supported by one or more application components in a health care setting.
 
 The function “execution of diagnostic procedures” can be supported by one or more application components in a health care setting.

 The CPOE system has an object identity of “patient.” The RIS and the LIS have an object identity of “case.” The OMS has an object identity of “order.” The LIS and the RIS can be linked to a “case identification number” (CIN) of the health care facility.
 
 ### 3.8.2 Domain Layer: Interoperability and Standards
 As we saw in the previous section, health information systems are characterized by containing many different application systems, i.e., they are usually of the AC^n architecture type.
 And we saw that these information systems can only guarantee data integrity in their health information systems if the application systems communicate with each other.
 Even more, this communication is the absolute prerequisite for the health information system to fulfill its task of ensuring the necessary data and knowledge logistics.
 
 Thus, application systems need to be able to communicate—they need to be interoperable.
 Without interoperability, no meaningful integration of application systems within health information systems is possible.
 Integration means that the application systems are put together in such a way that the information system—as opposed to its parts—displays a new quality.
 There are various kinds and aspects of integration, as we will discuss later in Sect. 3.8.1.
 
 Interoperability in general is the ability of two application systems to exchange information with each other and thus to be able to obtain information from both.
 Aspects of interoperability comprise the following aspects:
 - the ability of two application systems to exchange information via a given communication interface,
 - the availability of two application systems to exchange information via a given communication interface, and
 - the availability of two application systems to exchange information via a given communication interface (e.g., can both application systems access relevant patient diagnosis data via a given communication interface).
 - the availability of two application systems to support a given function (e.g., can both application systems support patient admission?).
 - the availability of two application systems to support a given function (e.g., can both application systems support patient admission?)

 Management of information systems (short: information management) is an enterprise function that is performed in health care facilities.
 It depends on and must be aligned to the facility’s vision, mission, and strategic goals.
 
 Organization of information management: The structure of the information management organization must be defined in such a way that it is aligned with the facility’s vision, mission, and strategic goals. An organization for strategic management of information systems should clarify which processes are well supported by the information system and which processes are well supported. It may help to state, for example, that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse.

 The CPOE system is used in several countries for sharing clinical documents between different facilities.
 
 ### 5.4.2 Certification of Health Information Systems
 There exist several national and international approaches for certification of application software products to be used in health care, such as the European CE certification, the German digital health application (DiGA) repository, the ONC Health IT Certification Program in the U.S. and IHE Connect.
 These are examples.
 For the European CE certification, a health information system must fulfill very high standards with regard to safety, health, and environment.
 For the German digital health application (DiGA), this means that the application must offer very high support for health care professionals in terms of data quality, semantic definition, user interface, context-solving, feature integration, and process integration.
 For the ONC Health IT Certification Program, no redundant application systems are allowed and thus, if an application system is certified through this program, it must be used in all its intended uses, i.e., in all its information processing tools must be used as intended.
 
 The ISO 901 standard defines criteria for the quality management system, an organization must fulfill all its processes, and an organization must fulfill all its stakeholders’s requirements.
 An ISO 900 certificate states that an organization follows certain formalized quality processes, that it monitors the outcome of its processes, and that it facilitates their continuous improvement.
 
 The ISO 27001 standard focuses on information security management.
 An ISO 27001 certificate states that an organization has an established information security management system and is able to manage the security of information, such as employee information, patient information, or financial information.
 
 The Joint Commission standard focuses on management of information systems and addresses issues such as data privacy, information security, standardization of data collection, and interoperability of data.

 # 3. Technological Perspective: Architecture of Integrated Information Systems
 ## 3.1 Introduction
 From the previous chapter, we already know that a health information system is the socio-technical subsystem of a health-related setting which comprises all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.
 In this chapter, we first look at what these information systems look like, i.e., we take the technological perspective and examine the architecture of data, information, and knowledge processing tools.
 We will then (in Sect. 3.4) look at health information systems’ organizational structures, such as top management, clinical and administrative departments,","A typical hospital needs all functions to function as expected.

 The most appropriate answer is that the application components that are relevant for the given situation are used at the same way that they are in a health care facility in other functions.
 For example, the CPOE system and the RIS use the same way of communication when they are used for diagnostic services at a health care facility.
 
 ### 3.9.2 Domain Layer: Interoperability and Standards

 - the availability of features in both application systems,
 - the availability of processes in both application systems,
 - the availability of tools for data, information, and knowledge processing in both application systems, and
 - the availability of training and education in both application systems.
 
 The following criteria help to assess the quality of interoperability of application systems:
 - Data integration,
 - semantic integration,
 - user interface integration,
 - context integration,
 - feature integration,
 - process integration.

The introduction of application systems may have unintended effects.
The careful evaluation of impact and unintended effects of application systems is thus an important task of management of information systems.
We will now have a look at an example of an evaluation study that showed some unintended effects of CPOE systems.
Table 5.1 presents the abstract of an RCT on automatic alerts in a CPOE system.
The authors analyzed whether the so-called hard-stop alert can reduce unwanted drug–drug interactions.
Such a “hard-stop alerts” appears on the screen to alert the physician about potential problems associated with a particular prescription and blocks the clinician’s order from further execution to avert potentially serious reactions.

Table 5.1: Abstract from “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert” [5]
- Background: The effectiveness of CPOE systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts
- Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” CPOE system prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007
- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33).

 Several factors may hinder the use of CDS in primary care: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some content, and the complexities of information about work-related processes.
 These factors are especially relevant if the application software products do not consist of commercial-related processes and if they are not explained in detail.
 The results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.
 
 ### 5.5.3 Certification of Health Information Systems
 There exist several national and international approaches for certification of application software products to be used in health care, such as the European CE certification, the German digital health application (DiGA) repository, the ONC Health IT Certification Program in the U.S. and IHE Connectathons.
 These approaches are discussed in the next sections.
 
 The ISO 901 standard defines criteria for the quality management system, an organization for systematic information processing that defines goals, structures, and processes to meet given standards.
 An ISO 900 certificate states that an organization follows certain formalized quality processes, that it monitors the outcome of its processes, and that it facilitates their continuous improvement.
 
 The ISO 27001 standard focuses on information security management.
 An ISO 27001 certificate states that an organization has an established information security management system and is able to manage the security of information, such as employee information, patient information, or financial information.
 
 The Joint Commission standard focuses on management of information systems and addresses issues such as data privacy, information security, standardization of data collection, and interoperability of data. A subset of its standards focuses on management of information systems and addresses issues such as data privacy, information security, standardization of data collection, and interoperability of data.

For these kinds of questions, qualitative studies are often chosen.
Table 5.2 presents the abstract of such a qualitative study.
The authors analyzed need, barriers, and facilitators for clinical decision support (CDS) in primary care.
The study was performed as a qualitative, exploratory field study.

- Background: Although patients who work and have related health issues are usually first seen in primary care, providers in these settings do not routinely ask questions about work. Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices
- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings
- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations
- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work

Answer: "
In which of the health care settings above will the function medical admission need to be supported?,In which health care settings will the function medical admission need to be supported?,"
 The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.
 It comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
 It is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.
 Yet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for the first time or when a person is admitted to a specified ward.
 Furthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes when a patient is first admitted to a specified ward.

 ## 2.1 Introduction
 Health informatics specialists usually deal with ambiguous terms based in computer science, medicine, health sciences, business sciences, and related disciplines.
 In practice, ambiguous terms lead health informatics students and health care professionals in the same way that they are dealing with in this textbook.

 The “KIM” service from the telemonitoring system is used at the point of admission of patients.
 The CPOE system and the medical documentation system are used at the point of admission of patients.
 The KPOE system and the medical documentation system are used at the points of admission of patients in the other parts of the hospital, such as the KPOE system is used in the other parts of the hospital.
 
 ### 5.9.2 Domain Layer: Interoperability and Standards
 As we saw in the previous section, health information systems are characterized by containing many different application systems, i.e., they are usually of the AC^n architecture type.
 And we saw that these information systems can only guarantee data integrity in their health information systems if the application systems communicate with each other.
 Even more, this communication is the absolute prerequisite for the health information system to fulfill its task of ensuring the necessary data and knowledge logistics.
 
 Thus, application systems need to be able to communicate—they need to be interoperable.
 Without interoperability, no meaningful integration of application systems within health information systems is possible.
 Integration means that the application systems are put together in such a way that the information system—as opposed to its parts—displays a new quality.
 There are various kinds and aspects of integration, as we will discuss later in Sect. 3.8.
 
 Interoperability in general is the ability of two application systems to exchange information with each other and thus to be able to obtain information from both.
 Aspects of interoperability comprise the following aspects: - the ability of two application systems to exchange information via each other,
 - the availability of data in both application systems,
 - the availability of content in both application systems,
 - the availability of features in both application systems,
 - the availability of processes in both application systems,
 - the availability of tools for data, information, and knowledge processing in both application systems, and
 - the availability of training and education in both application systems.
 
 The following sections provide a more detailed interoperability analysis for health information systems.

 ### 1.2.2 Requirements of Various Stakeholders
 Consider the requirements of various stakeholders when it comes to health information systems supporting various life situations.
 Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems?
 
 Answer:
 While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
 For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
 However, health information systems may not be able to provide detailed information on complex diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) for several hours.

 While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
 For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
 However, physicians and nurses may not be able to access relevant information on given patients treated by other health care professionals and facilities if the patient agrees to having access to patient-related documents.

 Consider the following life situations.
 Which health-related services are used in these life situations and how do they communicate?
 
 Answer:
 While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
 For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
 However, health care professionals may not be able to access relevant information on patients treated by other health care professionals and facilities in the context of their diseases.

 ### 2.16.2 The Logical Tool Layer of CityCare
 At the logical tool layer of CityCare, the application systems that are relevant for the described scenario in CityCare and their communication are modeled. For a better overview, the institutional information systems and the jointly used application systems of the network are labeled by gray rectangles.
 
 The specialist medical office has one application system that is used for scheduling, documenting the medical history, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
 The application system is used by both the patient administration department and the medical history taking place in the hospital.
 
 For the jointly used application components, it are necessary to know which functions are well supported by which application component and which functions are supported.
 The following functions are well supported by which application component:
 - Function (from Sect. 3.3.2) | CityCare
 - Medical history | Medical history | Medical history
 - Medical procedure | Medical procedures are procedures performed by physicians for physicians and nurses or by administrative staff and other health care professionals in health care facilities, for example, X-ray examinations or operations

 Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once and then can use this data in the NMDS.
 
 Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.
 
 User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
 For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients’ hometown are displayed in the same place on the birthdate of each patient.
 
 Context integration would be considered high if the context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
 The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of patients in the second application system.
 
 feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.
 
 Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of nurse is supported in an efficient way.

 The CPOE system is already well adopted in one pilot department.
 It would therefore be used as an application system in that department.
 In the other pilot department, the CPOE system is not well adopted, even though it is the same application system.
 
 The CPOE system is used in both application systems, so it is hardly used as an application system in either application system.
