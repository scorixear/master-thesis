 #### 3.7.2.2 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)
 The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based document standard developed in the 1990s.
 It has been maintained by the HL7 organization since the early 20s.
 
 The standard is free to use and cover all necessary steps of the document’s creation and management, from the initial document creation to the final CDA-based document.
 
 The following main features can be supported by the standard:
 
 - creation of a document, for example, a radiology report,
 - distribution of a document, for example, a radiology report,
 - retrieval of a document, for example, a radiology report,
 - management of documents, for example, by storing and retrieving a radiology report,
 - presentation of a document, for example, a radiology report,
 - communication of a document, for example, a radiology report,
 
 The standard is available in different languages.
 
 The following main features can be supported by the standard:

Answer: "
Definieren Sie den Begriff „transinstitutionelles Gesundheitsinformationssystem“. Verwenden Sie dabei den Begriff des „Settings“.,"Define the term ""trans-institutional health information system"". Use the term ""setting"" for this purpose.","
 “A transinstitutional health information system (tHIS) is the socio-technical subsystem of a health care setting which comprises all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.”
 
 Please note that the definition of a transinstitutional health information system is not trivial.
 
 What is a Transaction Management?
 
 Transaction management ensures that every update of correct data in one or more database(s) will lead to another state in which the data in the respective database(s) are still correct.
 This turns out to be not trivial, especially for complex update operations, the so-called transactions.
 
 Thus, we can state that the management of information systems in the current era of digitization must be able to handle very complex information processing functions.
 
 We will discuss further details of transaction management in Sect. 3.​5.
 
 What is a Transaction Monitoring?
 
 Transaction monitoring is the continual checking whether the strategic information management plan is implemented as intended and whether the strategic information management plan is updated to reflect the actual state of the health information system.
 
 This is particularly important if, for example, the strategic information management plan contains a section on strategic project portfolio (Sect. 4.​3). Such a section contains a list of projects to be executed in the coming years.
 
 In order to be able to carry out such monitoring, monitoring needs to be supported by systematic data collection and systematic analysis.
 
 For example, the German data privacy law contains a list of projects to be executed in the next 10 years.
 Such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) contains a list of projects to be executed in the next 100.
 
 We will discuss further details of transaction monitoring in Sect. 4.​3.
 
 What is a Strategic Information Management Plan?
 
 The strategic information management plan represents the long-term planning of the health information system.
 This plan describes the state of the health information system, the business goals, the strategic information management plan","A transinstitutional health information system is the socio-technical subsystem which comprises all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.

Answer: "
Was ist ein Arztbrief?,What is a doctor's letter?,"
 
 A physician’s letter is a letter from a physician to a patient, for example, recommending that the patient take certain measures.
 
 The letter may be written in full or in part.
 
 The letter is addressed to a specific patient, for example, Mr. Russo.
 
 The letter is usually written in standardized form, for example, in a radiology report.
 
 The letter is often sent from the ordering unit of a radiology department to the receiving unit of a radiology department, for example, from the radiology report of Mr. Russo to the radiology report of Mrs. Russo.

 It supports the creation of a semantically fully defined EHR.
 
 The standard follows a detailed (maximum) 3-layer modeling approach.
 The first layer is the reference model, which contains the basic building blocks representing clinical concepts.
 The second layer is the modeling framework, which supports the construction of models and the management of their structure and their meaning.
 The third layer is the modeling result, which is the EHR.

 Look at the 3LGM^2 model of the nervous system of a 12-league Football.
 Use the 3LGM^2 modeling approach and create a model of the nervous system of a 12-league Football.
 
 The 3LGM^2 model of the nervous system of a 12-league Football consists of two parts: the part where the neurons communicate with each other and the part where the neurons communicate with the environment.
 The first part is the communication server.
 The second part is the communication link.
 
 The communication server is an application system standing at the center of the logical tool layer of a 3LGM^2 model.
 It supports the communication between the application systems and ensures communication security.
 
 The communication server is connected to a patient administration system, a RIS, a LIS, and a patient data management system (PDMS).
 
 The patient administration system provides a list of available beds and rooms in a hospital or a medical office.
 The RIS provides a list of available examination and treatment options.
 The PDMS provides a list of available radiologists.
 
 The patient administration system sends a message to the communication server.
 The communication server multicasts the message to the RIS.
 The RIS confirms the receipt of the message through a receipt message (ACK) that is sent back to the patient administration system.
 If a communication server such as the one described here is used, no communication link is needed.
 
 The patient administration system provides","openEHR is an open standard specification in health informatics that describes the management and storage, retrieval and exchange of health data in electronic health records (EHRs).

Wie kann man dynamische Aspekte von IS modellieren?,How can dynamic aspects of Information Systems be modelled?,"
 
 The most elaborate but also the most direct way of modeling the dynamic aspects of information systems is to model them from scratch.
 This is particularly true for complex systems, however, as they are more likely to contain a multitude of dependencies.
 For example, the CPOE system is connected to a patient administration system, a RIS, and a patient administration system.
 The CPOE system can be used to order drugs from a central pharmacy, and the CPOE system’s patient administration system can billing the patient’s insurance company.
 The CPOE system’s RIS is also connected to a patient administration system, which bills the patient’s insurance company and sends the relevant documents (e.g., recent lab values) to the ordering facility.

 #### 3.7.2 Interoperability Standards
 As said before, the costs of the implementation and maintenance of interfaces within heterogeneous health information systems can be significantly reduced when standards for interoperability are used.
 
 Within the logical tool layer of a health information system, there exist a multitude of standards, i.e., especially in the area of interoperability.
 
 As the most widely implemented and wellestablished standards, HL7 V2 and HL7 FHIR will be described.
 However, there are more.
 
 For example, the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MI-I) is being executed.
 Four consortia are establishing data integration centers (DICs) for the individual hospitals.
 
 The consortium SMITH (Smart Medical Information Technology for Health care) is establishing data integration centers for the SMITH network.
 
 The DICs are facilities that extract data from the electronic patient records of the respective hospitals to make them available for research.
 They also transform data and run all systems that enable cross-institution querying and data exchange, while at the same time taking care of use-and-access rights and their consent.
 
 The consortium SMITH",IHE stands for Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise.

Was tut ein Kommunikationsserver?,What does a communication server do  in the context of health information systems?,"
 Answer: A communication server is an application system used for the asynchronous receiving, buffering, and sending of messages.
 
 A message is a set of data on entities (e.g., administrative data of a patient) that is arranged as a unit in order to be communicated between application systems.
 
 A message type describes the structure of a sent message and determines the meaning of the individual parts of the message.
 
 A message type is either “machine-processable” or “machine-processable and human-processable.” The first type is “machine-processable.” This means that the application system can “understand” the structure of a sent message and act accordingly, for example, by using the information provided.
 The second type is “machine-processable and human-processable.” This means that the application system can “understand” the structure of a sent message and act accordingly, for example, by using the information provided and by interpreting the sent message’s semantics.
 
 A message type is either “machine-processable” or “machine-processable and human-processable.”
 
 #### 3.9.2 Interoperability: Ability of Two Application Systems to Communicate
 
 Interoperability is the ability of two application systems to communicate with each other and to use the interoperability standard of their choice.

Question: Which application system is usually used to display a laboratory finding in the University Hospital?
Answer: "
Wie würden sie die PWE eines KIS gestalten?,How would they design the physical tool layer of a HIS?,"
 
 The physical tool layer of a health information system consists of all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.
 
 The following sections provide an overview of the most relevant tools for data, information, and knowledge processing, i.e., the application systems and the physical data processing systems, as well as some of the more important tools for data, information, and knowledge processing, such as the telephone or the personal computer (PC).
 
 ### 2.14.1 Characteristics of Personal Devices
 In the new era of digitization, many functions mentioned in Sect. 3.3 are not only supported by the personal computer (PC).
 
 The PC is connected to a patient patient terminal, a PC screen, and a PC mouse.
 The physician uses both a PC and a telephone as a tool, for example, for ordering radiological examinations.
 
 The PC can be used to access the internet and to run certain application systems.
 
 The PC’s screen is typically divided into two areas: the PC’s “virtualized” area and the PC’s “non-virtualized” area.
 The “virtualized” area is an instance of the operating system and can be used to run certain application systems.
 The “non-virtualized” area is a physical tool, for example, a telephone or a PC.
 
 The PC’s “virtualized” area is also called “virtual machine.” It runs a certain operating system and can be used to implement application software products.
 The “virtual machine” is an instance of the operating system.
 
 The PC’s “virtualized” area is also called “virtualized server.” It runs a certain operating system and can be used to implement application software products.
 The “virtualized server” is an instance of the operating system.
 
 The PC’s “non-virtualized” area is also called “non-computer-based application component.” It is implemented by telephones, telefaxes, books, administrative stickers, or other non-computer-based tools.
 
 The PC’s “virtualized” area is connected to a patient patient",Redundancy by mirror servers,1,single,A_2021,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.
Question: How would they design the physical tool layer of a HIS?
Answer: "
Was ist der Unterschied zwischen dem PVS und dem PDMS?,What is the difference between the PMS and the PDMS?,"
 The PMS is a tool for managing the whole analysis procedure: from questionnaires to results.
 The PDMS is a tool for managing only the execution of diagnostic procedures.
 
 ### 3.4.13 Laboratory Information Systems (LIS)
 Laboratories exist as functional areas within a hospital, for example, where a person with a severe case of a disease receives in-depth care.
 There, the blood sample is usually taken and the serum or plasma is usually measured.
 The results of a lab examination are usually given in a lab report.
 
 Laboratories can be divided into functional areas, for example, according to the type of laboratory (e.g., chemical or radiological). Chemical laboratories usually consist of automated equipment, which is regularly checked for their precision in order to conform to quality management requirements.
 Chemical laboratories also have a reception area for administrative purposes and, for example, waiting rooms for the patients’ relatives.
 
 In contrast to chemical laboratories, radiologists do not need automated equipment.
 They use a combination of digital images and a thorough analysis of the radiological report.
 The radiologist’s report is usually sent to the ordering unit, which also takes care of the necessary communication links.
 
 ### 3.4.14 Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)
 Images and X-ray dose information can be stored and communicated from the radiology department to the ordering unit in a radiology network.
 The storage medium is usually a picture archiving and communication system (PACS).
 
 The PACS offers storage, retrieval, management, manipulation, and communication of large amounts of image data and their quick communication from the storage medium to the attached radiologists’ workstations.
 The storage medium is usually a picture archiving and communication system (PACS).

Which functions update the patient information, which functions interpret it?","
 The entity type “patient” is interpreted by the function “get patient.” All other functions that are related to patient care interpret it.
 
 The entity type “patient” is decomposed into four entity types: “patient,” “case,” “order,” and “discharge letter.”
 
 The function “get Patient” is supported by the patient administration system.
 The entity type “discharge letter” is supported by the medical discharge letter writing application.
 
 #### 3.2.2 Entity Types About Managing Health Care
 Look at the entity type “discharge letter.” What is the meaning of the discharge letter?
 
 Answer:
 The discharge letter is a message from the discharging health care facility to the receiving health care facility.
 It contains the relevant diagnoses, treatment, and recommendations.
 
 The discharge letter is necessary because the receiving health care facility needs to be able to order further treatment.
 
 The entity type “discharge letter” is decomposed into four entity types: discharge letter A, discharge letter B, and discharge letter C.
 
 The function “discharge letter Writing” is supported by the patient administration system.

 The paper-based patient data privacy form system is indeed the master application system for the entity type “patient.” It supports the functions administrative admission, medical admission, nursing admission, and visitor and information services.
 The paper-based data privacy form system is scanned by the clerk and then stored in the MDMS.
 The MDMS can thus store the administrative patient data of a patient.
 The MDMS then sends a message (e.g., administrative admission) to the RIS.
 The RIS confirms the receipt of the message and sends back the administrative patient data of a patient.

Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type ""patient,"" sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type ""patient"" in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type ""patient"" is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM^2 classes.

 ## 2.16 Exercises
 ### 2.16.1 Domain Layer: Differences in Hospital Functions
 Look at the functions presented in Sect. 2.15. Select one hospital from the list and describe the differences of the","(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.
(b) The entity type ""patient"" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type ""patient,"" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.
(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.
(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
Pros (examples):
- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

Cons (examples):
- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.

Resolving these redundancies (examples):
- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).

The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
 
(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do",6,multi,Book,"Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.

 ### 3.8.2 Data Integration
 Imagine a situation in which a physician speaks with a patient at the patient’s bedside.
 The physician looks up the most recent blood pressure of a patient in the blood pressure monitor.
 The blood pressure monitor is connected to a patient terminal, PC and tablet PC.
 The physician admits that the blood pressure is a bit high, but that it is normal for the patient’s age.
 The physician explains this to the patient and advises him to take up mild physical activity and lose some of his excess weight.
 The patient agrees to take up mild physical activity and lose some of his excess weight.

","1. A physician enters a medical diagnosis for a patient first in the MDMS and later, when ordering an X-ray, again in the CPOE system. → No data integration, resulting in reentering of data, which is time-consuming and may lead to errors and inconsistencies in the data, which has the potential for patient harm.
 
2. The position of the patient’s name and the formatting of the patient’s birthdate vary between the MDMS and the CPOE system. → No user interface integration, resulting in increased time effort when using various application components, increased time needed for user training, and increased risk in overlooking or misinterpreting important patient information, which has the potential for patient harm.
 
3. When physicians shift from the MDMS to the CPOE system, they have to log in again and again search for the correct patient. → No context integration, leading to an increase in time needed to shift between application systems and an increased risk for selecting the wrong patient in the second application systems, which has the potential for patient harm.

 Common standards in health information systems include:
 - the standard for the overall architecture of the health information system,
 - the standard for the specific architecture of a health information system,
 - the standard for the operation of a health information system,
 - the standard for the users’ interface.
 
 The more common standards are, the more people will use and the more they will be familiar with.

Question: What types of integrity exist in the context of health information systems?
Answer: "
Welche Typen der Integration haben wir diskutiert?,What types of integration exist in the context of health information systems?,"
 Data integration, semantic integration, user interface integration, context integration, feature integration, and process integration are types of integration.
 
 Data integration is the process of data collection, analysis, and presentation, for example, from a patient administration system or a radiology information system (RIS).
 
 Semantic integration is the process of systematic, complete, and correct --> information exchange, for example, between a radiology information system and a picture archiving and communication system (PACS).
 
 User interface integration is the process of systematic, complete, and correct user interface design, for example, for a radiology information system (RIS).
 
 Context integration is the process of synchronizing and coordinating context among all application systems in a health information system.
 It ensures that a patient’s context is preserved when the patient changes the radiology, for example, from the RIS to the PACS.
 
 Feature integration is the process of systematically managing the application systems in a health information system.
 Feature integration is not needed in a health information system where the application systems are based on open specifications.
 
 Feature integration ensures that features are not implemented redundantly in multiple application systems.
 
 For example, the radiology report is a feature that should be supported by the radiology information system.
 The radiology report includes the radiologists’ report, the radiology report is the radiologists’ work, and the radiology report is the result of the radiologists’ work.
 The radiology report is needed by the ordering unit, for example, the ordering physician, and is sent from the radiology information system to the ordering unit.
 The radiology report is then sent back to the radiology information system.
 
 Feature integration reduces the need to exchange and reenter data.
 
 Finally, process integration is the process of systematically managing the application systems in a health information system.

 # 3. Architecture of Health Information Systems
 ## 2.1 Introduction
 In this book, we want to clearly and unambiguously describe the systems needed to ensure the information system of an organization.
 For this reason, we need clear concepts to describe the information system.
 For this reason, we introduce the concept of a system’s architecture.
 
 `An architecture of an information system describes its fundamental organization, represented by its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and by the principles guiding its design and evolution.`
 
 We will go through the three layers of an information system: the domain layer, the logical tool layer, and the physical tool layer.
 For each layer, we will explain, step by step, the layer’s components and how they are to be assembled and integrated to achieve what users experience as the health information system.
 
 We will also discuss the role of management of information systems and the strategic and tactical management of information systems.
 
 We will also discuss the basic building blocks representing the structure of the health information system: the domain layer, the logical tool layer, and the physical tool layer.
 
 We will also discuss the role of management of information systems and the strategic and tactical management of information systems.

Welche Bedeutung hat die Softwareentwicklung in einem Krankenhaus?,What is the importance of software development in a hospital?,"
 
 The role of management of information systems in a hospital depends on the size of the hospital.
 In small hospitals, management of information systems might focus on tactical and even strategic management of the information system.
 In larger hospitals, management of information systems is more likely to focus on strategic management of the information system.

 Answer:
 The function of a small hospital is to provide efficient, high-quality health care.
 The function of a large university medical center is to provide efficient, high-quality health care and to be able to research and education.
 
 The different health care professional groups (physicians, nurses, administrators, researchers, teachers) have different perceptions and interests.
 This leads to different strategies and different tactics.
 The role of management of information systems thus varies between two extremes.

Answer: "
Was ist Transaktionsmanagement? Wie wird das in KIS organisiert?,What is transaction management? How is it organised in HIS?,"
 Transaction management ensures that every update of correct data in one or more database systems will lead to another state in which the data in the other database system(s) are still correct.
 This turns out to be not trivial, especially for complex update operations, the so-called transactions.
 
 Transaction management guarantees that the application system will automatically follow patient, user, and other contexts.
 It also provides a correctness of the overall health information system’s architecture.
 
 In health information systems, every state and every state’s citizens must be able to read and enter the data needed for their health care.
 This turns out to be not trivial, especially for complex update operations, the so-called transactions.
 
 In order to achieve data integrity, the application systems must be able to communicate with each other.
 In a health information system, this communication is classified into three layers, A, B, and C, according to their interface type (“if-type”). Sources of Type A are designed using standardized interfaces. There are application systems that only have standardized interfaces and are therefore referred to here as sources of Type B. There are application systems that also have standardized interfaces but are referred to here as sources of Type C. 
 In the previous section, we saw that there are various types of application systems in health information systems.
 Therefore, we will also discuss various types of interfaces in health information systems.
 
 We will first discuss the most important concepts for health information systems, i.e., the functions, the application systems, and the interfaces.

Was hat das Krankenhausinformationssystem mit einer ganzheitlichen Sicht auf den Patienten zu tun?,What does the hospital information system have to do with a holistic view of the patient?,"
 The hospital information system is the so-called master patient index (MPI). It contains a list of all the patient’s past and present addresses, the date of his or her birth, and other relevant information.
 
 The MPI is used by all application components of a hospital, and in fact by most of the application components of a health care setting, for the retrieval of a patient’s past and present address.
 
 The MPI is also used by researchers for administrative admission of a patient, for example, when a new patient is admitted to a hospital, the relevant patient data and address are documented for the first time.
 
 The MPI is stored by a dedicated database server.
 
 The MPI is the basis for all application components that require a correct PIN, for example, for ordering drugs or for retrieving recent patient information.

 ### 5.5.2 Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Setting
 Besides evaluating the effect of a CPOE system, we will also look at the effect of other application systems on the health status of the working population.
 We will thus take a closer look at the role of primary prevention and wellness in maintaining the health of the working population.
 
 ### 5.5.1 Characteristics of Worker Health
 The World Health Organization’s constitution defines work as a right of all people.
 And the right to health care is a function of the right of people to an adequate standard of living.
 In addition to primary prevention (prevention of diseases promoted by a lack of primary prevention, for example, high blood pressure and diabetes), the World Health Organization’s constitution also supports wellness, which is a lack of diseases promoted by a lack of wellness, for example, high blood pressure and diabetes.
 
 ### 5.5.2 Technological Perspective
 In the case of well-designed and well-implemented information systems, the desired information and knowledge logistics is supported.
 The desired information and knowledge is provided at the right time, at the right place, to the right people, and in the right form.
 
 In the case of badly-designed and badly-implemented information systems, the desired information and knowledge is not provided, leading to the feeling of being left behind in the technological race.
 
 ### 5.5.3 Management Perspective
 In the case of well-designed and well-implemented information systems, management of information systems is typically seen as a success.
 The information system is considered to be a good support of the business processes.
 The desired information and knowledge logistics is supported.
 The desired information and knowledge is provided at the right time, at the right place, to the right people, and in the",Study “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-stop Alert”: The effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” alert was evaluated in a field study. The data was collected via analysis of the prescriptions in the CPOE systems. The overall data collection method is thus a quantitative observation of available data.,1,transfer,Book,"### 5.5.1 Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert
The introduction of application systems may have unintended effects.
The careful evaluation of impact and unintended effects of application systems is thus an important task of management of information systems.
We will now have a look at an example of an evaluation study that showed some unintended effects of CPOE systems.
Table 5.1 presents the abstract of an RCT on automatic alerts in a CPOE system.
The authors analyzed whether the so-called hard-stop alert can reduce unwanted drug–drug interactions.
Such a “hard-stop alerts” appears on the screen to alert the physician about potential problems associated with a particular prescription and blocks the clinician’s order from further execution to avert potentially serious reactions.

Table 5.1: Abstract from “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert” [5]
- Background: The effectiveness of CPOE systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts
- Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” CPOE system prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007
- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33). However, the study was terminated early because of four unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in two patients and a delay of treatment with warfarin in another two patients
- Conclusions: An electronic hard-stop alert as part of an inpatient CPOE system seemed to be extremely effective in changing prescribing habits. However, this intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in four patients who needed immediate drug therapy. These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended consequences of programmatic interventions intended to improve prescribing habits

The study was designed as a quantitative, explanatory field study that was conducted as an RCT.
The study found that these alerts can help to reduce the number of alert-triggering orders.

 The study found several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health.
 
 The results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.
 
 ### 5.5.3 Certification of Health Information Systems
 exist several national and international approaches for certification of application software products to be used for application systems, such as the European CE cert, the ONC Health IT Certification in the U.S., the ONC Health care Certification in Canada, the ONC Health care Certification in the U.K., the ONC Health care Certification in Australia, and the IHE Connect Certification in the U.S.
 
 In the European Union, the Medical Devices Regulation 201/1/31 [7] is the basis for the European CE cert.
 The German digital health App (DiGA) repository is maintained by the Institute for medical Devices and lists health apps that fulfill a number of quality requirements.
 In the U.S., the Health IT Certification Program is operated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).
 
 In the United Kingdom, the Health care Certification Program is operated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health care (ONC).
 In Canada, the Health care Certification Program is operated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health care (ONC).
 In the United States, the Health IT Certification Program is operated by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health care (ONC).
 
 In addition to these certificates, also exists the IHE Connect Certificate.
 This is not a standards certificate as such as the ones described above.
 Instead, it is a document repository for research-relevant, i.e., non-standards, non-computer-based application components.

Besides evaluating the effect of an intervention, evaluation may also try to understand reasons for successful or unsuccessful implementation of an application system.
For these kinds of questions, qualitative studies are often chosen.
Table 5.2 presents the abstract of such a qualitative study.
The authors analyzed need, barriers, and facilitators for clinical decision support (CDS) in primary care.
The study was performed as a qualitative, exploratory field study.

Table 5.2: Abstract from “Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Settings.” [6]

- Background: Although patients who work and have related health issues are usually first seen in primary care, providers in these settings do not routinely ask questions about work. Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices
- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings
- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations
- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work

It comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
It is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.
Yet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for a clinical trial and their data are entered into an EDC system.
Furthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes, as do rehabilitation facilities and—to a limited extent—wellness or sports facilities.
For personal environments, medical admission also plays a role, especially in telecare situations or when prevention measures are conducted, respectively.",4,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

 ### 3.7.2 Entity Types About Managing Health Care
 Look at the entity type “patient.” What is the meaning of the symbols “patient,” “case,” and “order”?
 
 Answer:
 “patient”: a person who is the subject of health care.
 “case”: a patient’s stay at a certain health care facility from patient admission until discharge.
 “order”: a physician’s orders to a laboratory, for example.
 
 The “patient Entity type” is decomposed into four entity types: “patient,” “case,” “order,” and “discharge letter.”
 
 The “patient Entity type” is the most important entity type for a person in a health care setting.
 It contains the administrative patient data and, for example, the address and insurance data.
 
 The “discharge letter” is a message from the discharging health care facility to the next health care facility containing, for example, the diagnoses, therapies, and recommendations.

 Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents the administrative patient data only once and then can use this data in the NMDS.
 
 Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (e.g., NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS.
 
 User interface integration would be considered high when the nurse documents the administrative patient data using a standardized user interface.
 
 Context integration would be considered high when the nurse documents the administrative patient data in one place and then can use this context in the NMDS.
 
 Feature integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (e.g., NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS.
 
 Process integration would be considered high when the nurse documents the administrative patient data, the NMDS then executes the necessary procedures, and the nurse receives confirmation on the completion of the process.
 
 ## 3.8 Logical Tool Layer: Types of Application Systems in Health Information Systems
 In this section, we will discuss the most important application systems in health information systems.
 
 As explained in Sect. 2.​13, we use application systems to support functions.
 
 We will discuss the most important application systems in health information systems, i.e., the application systems supporting the functions.
 
 We will explain which functions are supported by which application systems and which application systems are used by which functions.

","Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",6,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question.
