Ad hoc monitoring activities help to analyze a certain situation in the context of the health information system.\n For example, an ad hoc monitoring activity may be initiated after the introduction of a computer-based nursing management and documentation system (NMDS) and its related data.\n Ad hoc monitoring activities help to analyze the quality of the data in the NMDS.\n For example, an ad hoc monitoring activity may help to analyze the quality of the entity types “patient” and “case.”\n \n ### 3.9.4 Strategic Directing\n Strategic directing of information systems is a consequence of planning the information systems and monitoring the quality of the data in the NMDS and the quality of the information that is provided by the health care team.\n Directing, as part of strategic management of information systems, is transforming the strategic information management plan into action, i.e., system of concepts, into action.\n The system of concepts is a description of what the health care team is doing, for example, to support the vision and mission of the health care facility.\n The system of action is a description of how the health care team is doing its work.\n \n The following strategic directing activities can be distinguished:\n - Initiating projects from the strategic project portfolio,\n - Planning projects from the strategic project portfolio,\n - Executing work packages within an evaluation project of a component,",

     "true_answer": "Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.\n\nSemantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.\n\nUser interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.\nFor example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.\n\nContext integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.\nThe nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.\n\nFeature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.\n\nProcess integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",
