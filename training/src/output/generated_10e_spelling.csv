Definieren Sie den Begriff „Krankenhausinformationssystem“.,"Deffine the term ""hosptial information sistems"".","
 - Hospitals can be considered as quite complex entities.
 - Therefore, nearly all functions mentioned in Chap. 3, together with their data to be processed, are considered, as well as many of the application components that are usually used.
 - The functions of patient care are mostly similar to those described for patients in Chap. 3.
 - The application components that are relevant for the functions are described in Chap. 3.
 - The functions of patient care are performed in all relevant application components of health care facilities.
 - The application components of health care facilities can be considered as interoperable application components.
 - As interoperable application components, application components can be considered as combining an application system with a non-computer-based application component in such a way that the resulting information system is supported by one or more application components.
 - An application system is interoperable with respect to a certain function of health care facilities if it is syntactically interoperable with respect to all its subfunctions are supported by one or more application components of health care facilities and if the application components can communicate with each other in a standardized manner.
 - The interoperability of application systems is a property of the information system of a health care facility as a whole.

Ist openEHR ein Standard?,Is openEHR a standerd?,"
 openEHR is an open standard for highly structured EHRs and an open standard for highly unstructured EHRs.
 It reduces the indeterminacy of the way of interaction, for example, between HL7 V2 and openEHR by proposing clear rules for their joint use.
 The open specification includes openly available REST APIs for programmers and vendors and supports several implementation/representation formats.
 Finally, it makes it possible to build a full, vendor-independent EHR within and across health care facilities.

 # 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
 ## 2.1 Introduction
 Health informatics specialists usually deal with ambiguous terms based in computer science, medicine, health sciences, business sciences, and related disciplines.
 In practice, ambiguous terms lead health informatics students and health care professionals in the same way that they are dealing with in this textbook.
 One major objective of this textbook is to provide the reader with a clear terminology, i.e., a system of concepts and related terms and their treatment, for health information systems and their management.
 Such a terminology helps health informatics students and health care professionals in specifying, describing, and communicating their objectives, their tasks, and their working results.
 
 This chapter introduces the terminology for health information systems and their management as used","Yes, openEHR is an open standard specification in health informatics that describes the management and storage, retrieval and exchange of health data in electronic health records.",1,single,IS_2022_09_27,,"Instruction: You are given a question.

Answer: "
Was ist ein Modell?,What is a modle in the context of health information sistems?,"3LGM^2 is a metamodel for modeling (health) information systems.
 It links the logical and physical tools that are used in health information systems to health care functions, which describe the tasks to be performed in certain health care settings, for example, when and by whom
 - Application components are sets of implemented rules which control data processing of certain physical and logical tools. A component can be either computer-based application components (--> application component) or non-computer-based application components (paper-based application component)
 - Application software products are sets of implemented rules which control the purchase or introduction of application components from vendors. A software product from a vendor may consist of different modules for different functional areas (e.g., a module for operation planning and execution, a module for nursing).
 - Vendors may offer different modules for different functional areas by themselves (e.g., a module for operation planning and execution, a module for nursing).
 - Vendors may also offer tools for decision support (e.g., an app for decision support planning, an app for decision support in general).
 - 
 The tools for data, information, and knowledge processing at a health care facility are called the information system.
 - 
 `An information system is defined as that socio-technical subsystem of a health-related setting which comprises all data, information, and knowledge processing as well as the associated human or technical actors in their respective data, information, and knowledge processing roles.`
 
 As stated above, if a facility has an information system from the beginning of its existence, it is usually chaired by one or more application components that support information processing functions.
 The information system of a health care facility is called the health care facility’s information system.

 The request was made by the ordering unit of the hospital.
 It is nowhere in the LIS.
 
 ### 3.9.2 Supply and Disposal Management, Scheduling, and Resource Allocation
 The health care facility must offer sufficient and well-organized resources for patient care.
 This is true for wards (ward management) as well as outpatient units (outpatient management). Efficient process organization is extremely important, for example, in outpatient units or outpatient units, and can be supported, for example, by providing working lists for individual staff members by issuing reminders about appointments or by visualizing actual process flow.
 The facility’s information system must be able to support communication of all involved units and facilities involved in patient care.
 This comprises, for example, synchronous (e.g., telephone) and asynchronous (e.g., blackboards, brochures, email) communication.
 Staff members must be able to be contacted within a prescribed period of time.
 
 **Supply and Disposal Management**
 Supply and disposal of materials, food, drugs, and so on must be guaranteed.
 - Catering
 - Material and medication management
 - Laundry management
 - Management of medical devices
 - Scheduling and resource allocation
 
 **Human Resources Management**
 - This contains all tasks for the development and improvement of the productivity of staff.
 - It comprises, for example, staff and position planning, the staff register, staff scheduling, and staff payroll.
 - administration of human resource master data,
 - human resource planning,
 - work organization and time management,
 - payroll accounting,
 - administration of business trips and further training.
 - performance of legal notification requirements, for example, data on quality of life.
 
 #### Reference Management of Information Systems (RMIS)

 ### 3.8.2 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported by Health care Facilities
 In Sect. 3.7, we introduced the data to be processed and provided.
 Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these entity types are processed in health care facilities.
 As explained in Sect. 2.8, we can look at both the logical and the physical tools that are used in health care facilities.
 The following functions are used in health care facilities:
 - Function (from Sect. 3.3.2) | Typical features
 - Medical admission | Provide means for check-in of patient. Provide forms for documenting medical history. Provide forms for documenting diagnosis.

 The function “patient admission” is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system, which is used by administrative patients when they are first admitted to a specific ward. The function “medical admission” is supported by the MDMS.
 The function “nursing admission” is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
 The function “patient identification” is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system and the MDMS.

 The function “medical history” is supported by","Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.
One entity type that is used and updated by this function is “patient.” The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on.",6,multi,Book,"Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.

Answer the question to your best knowledge.
Question: Use the provided exemple to explain the meaning of the following elements: funtions, entity types, application sistems, non-computer-based application componets, physical data proccessing system, and inter-layer relationchips.
Context: Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM^2 classes.

 Qualitative data comprises text and any other non-numerical data.
 Qualitative data can describe individual situations and contexts in quite some detail.
 The following example will be used in many parts of this book:
 - A physician enters a medical diagnosis for a patient first in the medical documentation and management system (MDMS) and later, when ordering an X-ray, again in the CPOE system.
 - The position of the patient’s name and the formatting of the patient’s birthdate vary between the MDMS and the CPOE system.
 - When physicians shift from the MDMS to the CPOE system, they have to log in again and again, even when using the same application system.
 - Context is maintained when the application systems are used by different user groups, which is quite common in health information systems. A task that is used in many health care facilities is to be performed by different groups of health care professionals in different facilities.

Nennen Sie zwei Kommunikationsstandards für KIS?,Name to communication standerds for HIS?,"
 HIS communication standards for health information systems as used in hospitals, for example, consist of the application systems (e.g., LIS or OMS) and the physical data processing tools (e.g., ward computers, mobile computers) discussed in Sects. 3 and 4. However, they also contain complex genetic tools from sequencing, also called “omics” data. Each of the three tools that are used in the study (e.g., LIS, OMS, and Ploetzberg Hospital) are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
 
 ### 3.11.2 Domain Layer: Functions to Be Supported
 In Sect. 3.8, we introduced the data typical for health care settings and described the functions of health care settings.
 Now we will explain where and in what contexts data on these functions are processed in health care settings.
 As explained in Sect. 2.8, we use information-processing functions—or short: functions) as sets of cooperating application systems.
 
 You will remember that functions can be structured into a hierarchy of functions, where a function can be described in more detail by refined subfunctions.
 For example, nursing admission can be seen as a subfunction of patient admission. A function can be either supported by one application component or by a set of combined (“orchestrated”) application components.
 In health care, the interoperability standards openEHR (FHIR) and open SNOMED CT are well-known for the implementation of this function (Sects. 3.72.8 and 3.72221).
 Communication of data between application systems is classified into three categories, A, B, and C, according to their interface type (“if-type”). Sources of Type A are designed using IHE profiles.
 There are application systems that can serve HL7 and DICOM standards but do not fully implement IHE profile.
 They are referred to here as Type B sources.
 Type C sources are proprietary, such as data provided by comma-separated value (CSV) files.
 
 The “Data Integration Engine” executes data transformation and load processes from sources into a health care facility.","HL7, DICOM",2,multi,A_2021,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

 ### 2.16.8 Operation Management Systems (OMS)
 Invasive procedures for patients at a particular health care facility are performed in the operating rooms (ORs) at this facility.
 These procedures may be performed by physicians and other health care professionals or may be supported by one or more operation management systems (OMS).
 
 Operation management systems support execution of operations as a specialization of execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
 They allow operation date and time to be assigned and should therefore therefore be available on the wards as well as in the offices and management units of the OR.
 Depending on the planned operations, an operation plan can be created for a day or a week.
 The data necessary for efficient planning are the diagnoses of the patient, the planned operation (medical procedure), the surgeons and other staff involved (human resources), the planned time for operation (appointment), and the available OR (space). Therefore, the OMS should be closely connected to the MDMS.
 
 A vast amount of data must be documented during each operation, including the members of the operating team, the operative procedure, the date and time, duration of the operation, materials (e.g., implants) that were used, and other necessary data to describe the operation and its results.
 Surgeonsics need a lot of data for billing purposes, and operation data form the backbone of billing data.
 The OMS should therefore also provide supportive features for anesthesiologists and billing staff by providing reminder for fulfilling of legal reporting requirements.
 
 ### 2.16.9 Patient Data Management Systems (PDMS)
 Patients in critical situations are treated in intensive care units (ICU). These patients are generally in an unstable state and within seconds may enter into a life-endangering situation.

Welche Bedeutung hat die Softwareentwicklung in einem Krankenhaus?,What is the importence of software developement in a hospitul?,"
 - Software development is the precondition for exchanging and exchanging the application software products of a hospital.
 - The application software products of a hospital can be described by several characteristics: - Application software products from different vendors, pointing to the fact that the hospital combines the “best” application software products from different vendors.
 - As clinical workflowures often change, application software products are adaptable to workflow changes.
 - An application system is interoperable with respect to a given process if it is syntactically interoperable with respect to both the process and the application software product from all involved vendors when it is syntactically interoperable.
 - The more business-related the processes to be supported are, i.e., the more they correspond to the function in Sect. 3.​3, the more semantic interoperability an application system must have.
 - The more data are structured into a standardized manner (compare Sect. 3.​2) when the data are stored in an application system, the easier patient-related computer-based decision support and statistical data analysis are.
 - The more data are analyzed using standardized observation protocols (such as COBIT [1] as a framework for IT governance (Sect. 5.​2.​1). the easier management of information systems is.
 - The more data are structured into categories (such as “patient” and “case”) when the data are being processed in an application system, the easier patient-related computer-based decision support and statistical data analysis are.
 - The more data are structured into a standardized manner (such as COBIT [1] when the data are being processed in an organization, the easier management of information systems is.

Answer: "
In which of the health care settings above will the function medical admission need to be supported?,In which health care setings will the function medical admision need to be suported?,"
 The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.
 It comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
 It is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.
 Yet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for the first time or when documents for the person are being taken to another health facility for the first time.
 Furthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes when a patient is first assigned to a certain health care facility.

 # 2. Basic Concepts and Terms
 ## 2.1 Introduction
 Health informatics specialists usually deal with ambiguous terms based in computer science, medicine, health sciences, business sciences, and related disciplines.
 In practice, ambiguous terms lead health informatics students and health care professionals in the same way that they are dealing with in this textbook.
 One major objective of this textbook is to provide the reader with a clear terminology, i.e., a system of concepts and related terms and their treatment, for health information systems and their management.
 Such a terminology helps health informatics students and health care professionals in","The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.

 ### 1.2.2 Requirements of Various Stakeholders
 Consider the requirements of various stakeholders when it comes to health information systems supporting various life situations.
 Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems?
 
 Answer:
 While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
 For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
 However, physicians and nurses may not be able to access relevant information on certain patients treated by other health care professionals and facilities if the patient agrees to having their data privately owned.

 The right information: Current blood pressure measurement, blood prescription information, and recent blood pressure measurement.
 The right place: In the CPOE system, on the shelf of a hospital, on the display of the blood pressure measurement.
 The right people: The CPOE system has access to patient blood pressure measurement, for example, cancellation of blood pressure measurement, and for decision support.
 - In the right form: The blood pressure is provided in an easy-to-grasp, visual way. The CPOE system also provides decision support functionalities such as dosage calculation, drug–drug interaction checkser, drug allergy checkser, or drug lab checkser.
 - In order to make the right decision: The CPOE system should be able to provide decision support functionalities that help the health care professionals to decide on the next steps to take, for example, certain diagnostic or therapeutic decisions.
 - In addition, the CPOE system should also provide information on the quality of patient care and the performance and cost situation within the hospital.
 - When physicians write the discharge letter for a patient in the MDMS, they also need to code the discharge diagnosis of a patient. The CPOE system can therefore also be used for coding of discharge diagnoses and procedures.

 Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.
 
 Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.
 
 User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
 For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients’ hometown are displayed in the same place on the birthdate of each patient.
 
 Context integration would be considered high if the context is preserved when the nurse shifts from application system to application system.
 The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of patients in the second application system.
 
 feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.
 
 Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of nurse is supported in an efficient way.

 - Functional leanness: Situation where","Several solutions are possible here. One possible solution:
1. HIS user per mobile IT tool: Efficient information logistics everywhere (e.g., at the patient’s bedside) requires enough mobile IT tools.
2. Number of application systems: I would strive for an integrated information system and reduce the number of application systems in the long run in order to reduce integration problems.
3. HIS budget in relation to the overall hospital budget: Sufficient funding is the precondition for high-quality and well-integrated information system and the necessary competent IT staff.",3,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.

"Information systems managers can be partly compared to architects.
Read the following statement and discuss similarities and differences between information system architects and building architects [8]:

“We are architects.
[…] We have designed numerous buildings, used by many people.
[…] We know what users want.
We know their complaints: buildings that get in the way of the things they want to do.
[…] We also know the users’ joy of relaxing, working, learning, buying, manufacturing, and worshipping in buildings which were designed with love and care as well as function in mind.
[…] We are committed to the belief that buildings can help people to do their jobs or may impede them and that good buildings bring joy as well as efficiency.”","Informashun systems managers can be partly compared to architects.

 Health information managers can indeed be compared with architects.
 Health information managers design information systems that are used by many different user groups.
 Health information managers regularly monitor the quality of information systems to obtain feedback and to improve the information system.
 Health information managers understand that information systems support many different functions for many different user groups within health care facilities.
 Health information managers make sure that the application systems are user-friendly and support working processes in an efficient way.
 Health information managers understand that an information system serves the overall goal of a health care facility and ultimately serves the need of the patients.

"A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospital has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.
Disease registers are research databases for collecting data about a specific disease, aiming for full coverage of the respective patient collective.
The aim of a knee endoprosthesis registry is to collect longitudinal data to find out which type of endoprosthesis works best over time.
The researcher wants to integrate data from patient-reported outcome questionnaires, findings from inpatient or outpatient visits at the hospital, and results from laboratory examinations.
Which entity types need to be integrated and from which application components do they come?

Application components to be integrated depend on local settings and implementation but will likely include: patient administration system, MDMS, LIS, OMS, PDMS, and self-diagnosis systems (e.g., an app for collecting patient-reported outcome data) or patient portals.

A research architecture for setting up multiple registries might include a DWS for research that is fed via ETL processes from the above-mentioned application components and can be tapped for data in different use cases or research scenarios.
Finally, an open platform architecture would enable reuse of patient data in various research contexts.",3,transfer,Book,,"Instruction: You are given a question. Answer the question to your best knowledge.
