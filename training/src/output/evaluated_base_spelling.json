        "true_answer": "The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.\nIt comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.\nIt is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.\nYet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for a clinical trial and their data are entered into an EDC system.\nFurthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes, as do rehabilitation facilities and—to a limited extent—wellness or sports facilities.\nFor personal environments, medical admission also plays a role, especially in telecare situations or when prevention measures are conducted, respectively.",
