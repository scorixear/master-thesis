        "true_answer": "A good models should be able to help understand and predict the behavior of the system or process. It should also be able to help design and evaluate health information systems. A reference architecture can be used to support the design of a proper HIS architecture that meets the various stakeholder concerns of HISs. This architecture should be able to show the HIS from a different angle, suitable for various stakeholders.",

        "generated": "",
        "true_answer": "Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.\n\nSemantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.\n\nUser interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.\nFor example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.\n\nContext integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.\nThe nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.\n\nFeature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.\n\nProcess integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",
