        "context": "Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.\nMedical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.\nObtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.\nThis application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.\n\nThe patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type “patient,” sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.\nThe MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type “patient” in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.\nThe entity type “patient” is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.\n\nBoth the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).\n\nIt therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.\nAnother visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.\nThe patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.\nThe matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.\nWe can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.\n\nThe matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM^2 classes.",

When physicians shift from the MDMS to the CPOE system, they have to log in again and again search for the correct patient. → No context integration, leading to an increase in time needed to shift between application systems and an increased risk for selecting the wrong patient in the second application systems, which has the potential for patient harm.\n \n4.
