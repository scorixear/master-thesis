    "transformed": "What does the hospitul informashun sistem have to do with a holistik view of the patient?",
    "true_answer": "A hospital information system must provide the right information about patients in the right place to the right people at the right time. Ideally, this means that information about the patient is also taken into account holistically across departmental and case boundaries, e.g. for the optimal treatment of multimorbid patients and for the avoidance of side effects that can occur due to known allergies and multimedication and, in the worst case, lead to death. Additional costs, effort and patient treatment due to superfluous multiple examinations are avoided.",

    "true_answer": "Physicians: Important functions are medical admission, decision-making and patient information, planning and organization of patient treatment, order entry, execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, coding of diagnoses and procedures, and medical discharge and medical discharge summary writing. Nurses: Important functions are nursing admission, decision-making and patient information, planning and organization of patient treatment, order entry, execution of nursing procedures, and nursing discharge and nursing discharge summary writing. Administrative staff: Important functions are patient identification, administrative admission, and administrative discharge and billing.",

    "true_answer": "The physician wants to have access to the right information (the most recent blood pressure) at the right time (when talking to Mr. Russo) at the right place (at the patient\u2019s bedside) in the right form (hopefully the blood pressure is provided in an easy-to-grasp, visual way) so that he can make the right decision (here: to decide on the level of a certain medication).\nIf the information system does not support this, the physician may obtain an incorrect or outdated blood pressure measurement, or he may misinterpret it, thereby coming to a decision that is suboptimal for the patient.",

    "true_answer": "Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.\n\nSemantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.\n\nUser interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.\nFor example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.\n\nContext integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.\nThe nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.\n\nFeature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.\n\nProcess integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.",
