Umformuliert & Use the provided example to explain the meaning of the following elements: functions, entity types, application systems, non-computer-based application components, physical data processing system, and inter-layer relationships. \\
Kontext & Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.1) for the entity type "patient," sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type "patient" in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
The entity type "patient" is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM\^2 model elements is the matrix view.
The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM\^2 classes. \\
Antwort & Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.
One entity type that is used and updated by this function is "patient." The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on. \\

Antwort & (a) The function "patient admission" is decomposed into five subfunctions - patient admission is only complete if all the subfunctions are completed. The entity type "patient" is decomposed into four entity types - data regarding that entity type are only complete if data about all sub-entity types is complete. There are no examples of specialization at the domain layer of Fig. 2.11.

(b) The function "patient identification" updates the entity type "patient." The function "medical admission" uses the entity type "patient." This indicates that identifying patient data are updated or created during patient admission and then used for medical admission.
 
(c) The entity type "privacy statement" could be added at the domain layer. It would be updated by the function "obtaining consent for processing of patient data."
 
(d) Patient admission is decomposed into five subfunctions with each being linked to an application component by which it is supported. Therefore, it could lead to an ambiguous model if the superordinated function was linked with another application component. The corresponding modeling rule says that only the leaf functions in a function hierarchy should be linked to application components.
 
(e) The function "obtaining patient consent for the processing of data" is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system. For this, a paper record cabinet, a scanner, and a clerk handling these tools are the physical data processing systems needed for the function. \\

The hospital is now considering the introduction of a communication server to improve data integration.
Discuss the short-term and long-term pros and cons of this decision.
Which syntactic and semantic standards could be used? \\
Antwort & Short-term advantages: The communication server can handle the communication between all four application systems, including receiving, buffering, transforming, and multicasting of messages.
It can also be used for monitoring the communication traffic.
The communication server thus supports data integration in heterogeneous information system architectures.

Long-term advantages: In the resulting (ACn, CP1) architecture, new application components can easily be integrated, as only one communication interface to the communication server needs to be implemented.

Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used as syntactic or semantic standard.
For the exchange of clinical data, various communication standards can be chosen such as HL7 FHIR, DICOM for medical images, or HL7 CDA for clinical documents. \\

The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer. Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM\^2 classes. \\
Antwort & (a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.
(b) The entity type "patient" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type "patient," for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.
(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.
(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
Pros (examples):
- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

Cons (examples):
- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.

Resolving these redundancies (examples):
- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.35).

The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
 
(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do \\
