(a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems?

Why is there no communication link between the MPI and the patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, for example?\n (d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?\n (e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if “Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital” fails? Suggest the introduction of a better application server that also fails in case a single function is performed.\n (f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.\n \n Answer:\n (a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added as a function added at the domain layer. It would be supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also supported by the EHRS.",

        "true_answer": "(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.\n(b) The entity type \"patient\" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type \"patient,\" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.\n(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.\n(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.\nPros (examples):\n- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.\n- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.\n\nCons (examples):\n- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.\n- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.\n\nResolving these redundancies (examples):\n- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.\n- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.\n\n(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).\n\nThe application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.\n \n(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do",
