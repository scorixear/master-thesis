(a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems? Which functions (domain layer) that are added at the domain layer that that that are well supported by these application systems could be added at the domain layer of CityCare?\n (b) In which database systems shown in the logical tool layer should the entity type “patient” be stored?\n (c) The MPI should receive messages containing PINs (entity type “patient”) from all patient administration systems. Why is there no communication link between the MPI and the patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, for example?\n (d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?\n (e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if “Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital” fails? Suggest the introduction of a better application server that also fails in case a single function is performed.\n (f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.\n \n Answer:\n (a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added as a function added at the domain layer. It would be supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also supported by the EHRS.",
