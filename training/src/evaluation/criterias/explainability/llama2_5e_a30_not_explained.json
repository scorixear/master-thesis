        "generated": "The entity type “patient” represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN, which is the main prerequisite for being able to provide health care.\n The entity type “medical” represents persons who are the subject of medical care.\n Information about a medical entity type includes the diagnosis and treatment.\n The entity type “nursing” represents persons who are the subject of nursing care.\n Information about a nursing entity type includes the care planning.\n \n The entity types “patient,” “medical,” and “nursing” are each other’s master entity type.\n This means that the information about these entity types are the “best-of-breed” information.\n \n The entity types “patient,” “medical,” and “nursing” are each other’s “best-of-breed” information.\n \n ### 3.11.3 The Logical Tool Layer of CityCare\n At the logical tool layer, the application systems are the center of interest.\n As we can see, the application systems are not only used by one person.\n Rather, they are used by many different persons.\n We can also see that the application systems are not only used in one health care facility.\n Rather, the application systems are used in several health care facilities.\n \n The application systems of Ernst Jokl Hospital, for example, are used in several health care facilities.\n We can also see that the application systems of a patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​2) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” are used in several health care facilities.\n We can also see that the application system of a nursing management and documentation system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​3) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” is used in several health care facilities.\n We can also see that the application system of a CPOE system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.​4) for the entity types “patient” and “medical,” is used in several health care facilities.",
        "true_answer": "(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.\n(b) The entity type \"patient\" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type \"patient,\" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.\n(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.\n(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.\nPros (examples):\n- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.\n- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.\n\nCons (examples):\n- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.\n- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.\n\nResolving these redundancies (examples):\n- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.\n- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.\n\n(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).\n\nThe application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.\n \n(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems. Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do",
