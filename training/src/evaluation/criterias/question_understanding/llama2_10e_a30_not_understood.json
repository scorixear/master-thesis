        "true_answer": "(a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems. The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS. Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission. For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer. At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.\n(b) The entity type \"patient\" represents the persons who are the subject of health care. Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person. Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type \"patient,\" for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.\n(c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems. The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server. The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network. In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.\n(d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.\nPros (examples):\n- Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.\n- The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.\n\nCons (examples):\n- Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.\n- The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.\n\nResolving these redundancies (examples):\n- One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.\n- The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.\n\n(e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.​37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital. Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.​35).\n\nThe application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers. If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task. Thus, there is no interruption in function support.\n \n(f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE. For example, IHE XDS could be used. The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports. These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems.

        "true_input": "Instruction: You are given a question and a context. Answer the question to your best knowledge.\nQuestion: The following questions can be answered reading the provided text.\n(a) The EHRS and the VNA in CityCare are not linked with any function they support. Which function of the domain layer may (partly) be supported by these application systems? Which functions (as introduced in Sect. 3.3) that are supported by these application systems could be added at the domain layer?\n(b) In which database systems shown in the logical tool layer should the entity type \"patient\" be stored?\n(c) The MPI should receive messages containing PINs (entity type \"patient\") from all patient administration systems. Why is there no communication link between the MPI and the patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital?\n(d) According to the matrix view, which functions are supported redundantly in CityCare? Discuss pros and cons of the functional redundancies in this scenario. What redundancies would you resolve and how?\n(e) Which functions in which health care facility cannot be performed anymore if \"Application Server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital\" fails? Suggest a change to the physical tool layer that would minimize the risk of missing function support in case a single application server fails.\n(f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.\nContext: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.\nMedical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.\nObtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.\nThis application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.\n\nThe patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.​9.​1) for the entity type \"patient,\" sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.\nThe MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type \"patient\" in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.\nThe entity type \"patient\" is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.\n\nBoth the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).\n\nIt therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.\nAnother visualization of relationships between 3LGM^2 model elements is the matrix view.\nThe patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.\nThe matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.\nWe can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.\n\nThe matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer.

A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007\n- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33).

A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007\n- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33). However, the study was terminated early because of four unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in two patients and a delay of treatment with warfarin in another two patients\n- Conclusions: An electronic hard-stop alert as part of an inpatient CPOE system seemed to be extremely effective in changing prescribing habits. However, this intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in four patients who needed immediate drug therapy. These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended consequences of programmatic interventions intended to improve prescribing habits\n\nThe study was designed as a quantitative, explanatory field study that was conducted as an RCT.\nThe study found that these alerts can help to reduce the number of alert-triggering orders.\nBut it also found that the hard-stop alert led to clinically important treatment delays in four patients.\nAnswer:",
