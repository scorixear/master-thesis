Data on these entity types that are needed in other application systems have to be considered copies of the “best-of-breed” data.\n Consequently, only data in primary application systems can be updated directly by the application system; data integrity must be maintained by the other application systems by sending new copies of the “best-of-breed” data to the primary application system.\n \n In this way, the application system can be regarded as the center of the memory of the health information system.\n \n ### 3.9.4 3LGM^2 Model\n The following questions can be answered by analyzing the text and the structure of the 3LGM^2 model.\n (a) Find examples of specialization or decomposition at the domain layer.\n (b) What is the meaning of the arrows pointing from patient admission to “execution”?\n (c) Which entity type that is stored in which database",

Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care.

We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work\n- Conclusion: We discovered several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health\n\nThe authors found several factors that may hinder or foster the use of CDS in primary care.\nThe results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.",

Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices\n- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings\n- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations\n- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work\n- Conclusion: We discovered several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health\n\nThe authors found several factors that may hinder or foster the use of CDS in primary care.\nThe results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.\nAnswer:",
