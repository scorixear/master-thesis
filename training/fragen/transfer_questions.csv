Look at the functions presented in Sect. 3.3.2. Now imagine a small hospital (e.g., 350 beds) and a large university medical center (e.g., 1500 beds). What are the differences between these hospitals with regard to their functions? Explain your answer.;Imagine a small hospital (e.g., 350 beds) and a large university medical center (e.g., 1500 beds). What are the differences between these hospitals with regard to their functions to be performed by health care professionals and other staff in health care facilities? Explain your answer.;A typical hospital needs all functions to function as expected. The functions to be performed by health care professionals are mostly similar in all health care facilities, independent of their size. Only some functions may differ. For example, not all health care facilities are involved in clinical research, thus their information will not need to support the function research and education.;2;Book;
Wann ist ein Modell gut?;When is a model good in the context of health information systems?;A good models should be able to help understand and predict the behavior of the system or process. It should also be able to help design and evaluate health information systems. A reference architecture can be used to support the design of a proper HIS architecture that meets the various stakeholder concerns of HISs. This architecture should be able to show the HIS from a different angle, suitable for various stakeholders.;3;IS_2022_09_27;
Was hat das Krankenhausinformationssystem mit einer ganzheitlichen Sicht auf den Patienten zu tun?;What does the hospital information system have to do with a holistic view of the patient?;A hospital information system must provide the right information about patients in the right place to the right people at the right time. Ideally, this means that information about the patient is also taken into account holistically across departmental and case boundaries, e.g. for the optimal treatment of multimorbid patients and for the avoidance of side effects that can occur due to known allergies and multimedication and, in the worst case, lead to death. Additional costs, effort and patient treatment due to superfluous multiple examinations are avoided.;2;IS_2022_09_27;

The data was collected via analysis of the prescriptions in the CPOE systems. The overall data collection method is thus a quantitative observation of available data.;1;Book;"### 5.5.1 Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert
The introduction of application systems may have unintended effects.
The careful evaluation of impact and unintended effects of application systems is thus an important task of management of information systems.
We will now have a look at an example of an evaluation study that showed some unintended effects of CPOE systems.
Table 5.1 presents the abstract of an RCT on automatic alerts in a CPOE system.
The authors analyzed whether the so-called hard-stop alert can reduce unwanted drug–drug interactions.
Such a “hard-stop alerts” appears on the screen to alert the physician about potential problems associated with a particular prescription and blocks the clinician’s order from further execution to avert potentially serious reactions.

Table 5.1: Abstract from “Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert” [5]
- Background: The effectiveness of CPOE systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts
- Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly “hard-stop” CPOE system prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007
- Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045–0.33). However, the study was terminated early because of four unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in two patients and a delay of treatment with warfarin in another two patients
- Conclusions: An electronic hard-stop alert as part of an inpatient CPOE system seemed to be extremely effective in changing prescribing habits. However, this intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in four patients who needed immediate drug therapy. These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended consequences of programmatic interventions intended to improve prescribing habits

The study was designed as a quantitative, explanatory field study that was conducted as an RCT.
The study found that these alerts can help to reduce the number of alert-triggering orders.
But it also found that the hard-stop alert led to clinically important treatment delays in four patients."

";Given the Example in the Context, determine which methods for collecting data have been used.;Study “Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Setting”: data were collected via interviews and qualitative observations.;1;Book;"### 5.5.2 Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Setting
Besides evaluating the effect of an intervention, evaluation may also try to understand reasons for successful or unsuccessful implementation of an application system.
For these kinds of questions, qualitative studies are often chosen.
Table 5.2 presents the abstract of such a qualitative study.
The authors analyzed need, barriers, and facilitators for clinical decision support (CDS) in primary care.
The study was performed as a qualitative, exploratory field study.

Table 5.2: Abstract from “Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Settings.” [6]

- Background: Although patients who work and have related health issues are usually first seen in primary care, providers in these settings do not routinely ask questions about work. Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care. Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices
- Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings
- Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations
- Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing. We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools. Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model. Facilitators concerning usefulness include users’ need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data. Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities. Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work
- Conclusion: We discovered several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health

The authors found several factors that may hinder or foster the use of CDS in primary care.
The results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care."
In which of the health care settings above will the function medical admission need to be supported?;In which health care settings will the function medical admission need to be supported?;"The function “medical admission” is relevant in several health care and research settings.
It comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
It is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.
Yet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for a clinical trial and their data are entered into an EDC system.
Furthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes, as do rehabilitation facilities and—to a limited extent—wellness or sports facilities.
For personal environments, medical admission also plays a role, especially in telecare situations or when prevention measures are conducted, respectively.";4;Book;

Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems?";"While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
However, physicians and nurses may want to discuss the findings with the patient in person to avoid causing unnecessary confusion and stress in the patient.
Therefore, the health information system must be able to provide detailed information to physicians and nurses, but it must be able to only present confirmed information to the patient (e.g., via a patient portal).";2;Book;

Now consider the types of integration and discuss how this nurse would recognize a high (or low) level of data integration, semantic integration, user interface integration, context integration, feature integration, and process integration.
";"Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NMDS.

Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NMDS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NMDS.

Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.";6;Book;
