# Abstract
- dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks
- include encoder and decoder connected through attention mechanism
- Transformer, only attention mechanism, no reccurence and convolutions
- BLEU score of 41.8, 3.5 Days Training, 8 GPUs
