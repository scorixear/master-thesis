    Frage & Look at the 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 example in Sect. 2.15.
    Use this example to explain the meaning of the following elements: functions, entity types, application systems, non-computer-based application components, physical data processing system, and inter-layer relationships.\\
    Umformuliert & Use the provided example to explain the meaning of the following elements: functions, entity types, application systems, non-computer-based application components, physical data processing system, and inter-layer relationships.\\
    Kontext & Example: Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
    Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
    Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
    This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

    The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.1) for the entity type ``patient,'' sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
    The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type ``patient'' in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
    The entity type ``patient'' is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

    Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

    It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
    Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 model elements is the matrix view.
    The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
    The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
    We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

    The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer.
    Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 classes.\\
    Antwort & Administrative admission is an enterprise function that is supported by the patient administration system.
    One entity type that is used and updated by this function is ``patient.'' The paper-based patient data privacy form system is an example of a non-computer-based application component.
    The virtualized server farm is an example of a physical tool.
    The inter-layer relationships of this example show which functions are supported by which application system and which physical data processing system the application systems are installed on.\\

    Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 classes.\\
    Antwort & (a) The function ``patient admission'' is decomposed into five subfunctions - patient admission is only complete if all the subfunctions are completed.
    The entity type ``patient'' is decomposed into four entity types - data regarding that entity type are only complete if data about all sub-entity types is complete.
    There are no examples of specialization at the domain layer of Fig. 2.11.

    (b) The function ``patient identification'' updates the entity type ``patient.'' The function ``medical admission'' uses the entity type ``patient.'' This indicates that identifying patient data are updated or created during patient admission and then used for medical admission.
        
    (c) The entity type ``privacy statement'' could be added at the domain layer.
    It would be updated by the function ``obtaining consent for processing of patient data.''
        
    (d) Patient admission is decomposed into five subfunctions with each being linked to an application component by which it is supported.
    Therefore, it could lead to an ambiguous model if the superordinated function was linked with another application component.
    The corresponding modeling rule says that only the leaf functions in a function hierarchy should be linked to application components.
        
    (e) The function ``obtaining patient consent for the processing of data'' is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
    For this, a paper record cabinet, a scanner, and a clerk handling these tools are the physical data processing systems needed for the function.\\

    Umformuliert & Imagine a hospital information system that comprises four application systems: a PAS, an MDMS, a RIS, and a PDMS.
    The hospital is now considering the introduction of a communication server to improve data integration.
    Discuss the short-term and long-term pros and cons of this decision.
    Which syntactic and semantic standards could be used? \\
    Antwort & Short-term advantages: The communication server can handle the communication between all four application systems, including receiving, buffering, transforming, and multicasting of messages.
    It can also be used for monitoring the communication traffic.
    The communication server thus supports data integration in heterogeneous information system architectures.

    Long-term advantages: In the resulting (ACn, CP1) architecture, new application components can easily be integrated, as only one communication interface to the communication server needs to be implemented.

    Standards: For the exchange of administrative data, HL7 V2 or V3 could be used as syntactic or semantic standard.
    For the exchange of clinical data, various communication standards can be chosen such as HL7 FHIR, DICOM for medical images, or HL7 CDA for clinical documents.\\

    (f) For the CityCare network, would it make sense to implement further profiles from IHE? Explain your decision.\\
    Kontext & Four subfunctions of patient admission (appointment scheduling, patient identification and checking for readmitted patients, administrative admission, and visitor and information services) are supported by the patient administration system, which is a part of the ERPS.
    Medical admission and nursing admission are supported by the MDMS.
    Obtaining consent for processing of patient-related data is supported by the non-computer-based application component for patient data privacy forms.
    This application component is based on paper forms which are scanned by a clerk (see physical tool layer) and then stored in the MDMS.

    The patient administration system, which is the master application system (Sect. 3.9.1) for the entity type ``patient,'' sends the administrative patient data as a message to the MDMS.
    The MDMS can thus store this information about the entity type ``patient'' in its own database; administrative patient data that is needed to support medical admission and nursing admission as functions therefore do not have to be reentered in the MDMS.
    The entity type ``patient'' is both stored in the database systems of the ERPS and the MDMS what is represented by dashed lines between the domain layer and the logical tool layer.

    Both the patient administration system and the MDMS are run on servers at a virtualized server farm (see relationships between logical and physical tool layer). The application systems can be accessed by different end devices (patient terminal, PC, tablet PC).

    It therefore simplifies some aspects which might be relevant in other contexts.
    Another visualization of relationships between 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 model elements is the matrix view.
    The patient administration system supports three different functions, the MDMS supports two functions, and one function is supported by the paper-based patient data privacy form system.
    The matrix view also helps to identify incomplete parts of models.
    We can see that there are no functions modeled that are supported by the financial accounting system, the human resources management system, and the material management system, which are parts of the ERPS.

    The matrix view is an alternative representation of configuration lines between functions at the domain layer and application components at the logical tool layer.
    Matrix views are also available for visualizing relations between other pairs of connected 3LGM\textasciicircum{}2 classes.\\
    Antwort & (a) EHR systems as comprehensive application systems combine the functionalities of MDMS, NDMS, and CPOE systems.
    The EHRS of CityCare could therefore be used for medical admission, preparation of an order, or execution of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
    However, each of the three health care facilities in CityCare has its own MDMS.
    Therefore, the EHRS is probably mainly used for accessing findings from the other health care facilities, for example, during medical admission.
    For the VNA, no suitable function is modeled at the domain layer.
    At the domain layer, archiving of patient information could be added which is supported by the VNA and, to some extent, also by the EHRS.

    (b) The entity type ``patient'' represents the persons who are the subject of health care.
    Information about a patient includes the PIN and other administrative data about the person.
    Each of the application systems supporting subfunctions of patient care and having an own database system stores the entity type ``patient,'' for example, the patient administration system including the MPI, the MDMS, the EHRS, and the VNA.

    (c) In Ernst Jokl Hospital, there is a star architecture at the logical tool layer, i.e., a communication server is used for the exchange of messages between application systems.
    The patient administration system of Ernst Jokl Hospital, where the PINs of Ernst Jokl Hospital are generated, sends this information in a message to the communication server.
    The communication server forwards the message to the MPI of the health care network.
    In the central MPI of the tHIS, the local patient identification numbers of the different health care facilities are linked to the unique transinstitutional patient identification number of CityCare.

    (d) Administrative admission, appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, patient identification, and preparation of an order are each supported by at least three application systems in the scenario.
    Pros (examples):
    - Each of the health care facilities has a functioning information system that is independent from changes or system failures in the other health care facilities.
    - The different patient administration systems and medical documentation and management systems may be better adapted to the local needs and grown structures in the single health care facilities than an application system that is used by all of them together.

    Cons (examples):
    - Three or more different application systems that support the same function cause higher costs and higher administrative effort.
    - The effort for establishing integration and interoperability are higher in functional redundant architectures which have a high number of single application systems.\\
    & Resolving these redundancies (examples):
    - One patient administration system that supports patient identification and administrative admission could be used in all health care facilities instead of three patient administration system and an MPI.
    - The central EHRS could be used as MDMS, NDMS as well as CPOE system in each of the facilities and would replace the existing local application systems.

    (e) According to the matrix view in Fig. 3.37, the MDMS of Ploetzberg Hospital is installed on application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital.
    Thus, if this application server 1 Ernst Jokl Hospital fails, the following functions cannot no longer be performed: appointment scheduling, medical admission, order entry, and preparation of an order (see matrix view in Fig. 3.35).

    The application systems used in CityCare should be made available by server clusters with redundant servers.
    If one server in a server cluster fails, another server can take over its task.
    Thus, there is no interruption in function support.
        
    (f) Yes, it makes sense to use further integration profiles from IHE.
    For example, IHE XDS could be used.
    The CityCare network could be established as an affinity domain with several actors that interact in a standardized way (process interoperability) to share document-level or even large binary patient data, such as findings, images, or radiology reports.
    These documents would be registered centrally in a document registry and could be retrieved by other systems.
    Depending on how the central EHRS is implemented, it could either take the role of a do \\

    Kontext & \#\#\# 5.5.1 Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert
    The introduction of application systems may have unintended effects.
    The careful evaluation of impact and unintended effects of application systems is thus an important task of management of information systems.
    We will now have a look at an example of an evaluation study that showed some unintended effects of CPOE systems.
    Table 5.1 presents the abstract of an RCT on automatic alerts in a CPOE system.
    The authors analyzed whether the so-called hard-stop alert can reduce unwanted drug-drug interactions.
    Such a ``hard-stop alerts'' appears on the screen to alert the physician about potential problems associated with a particular prescription and blocks the clinician's order from further execution to avert potentially serious reactions.

    Table 5.1: Abstract from ``Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-Stop Alert'' [5]
    - Background: The effectiveness of CPOE systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts
    - Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly ``hard-stop'' CPOE system prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at two academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard-stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice.
    The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007
    - Results: The proportion of desired responses (i.e., not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 min of firing) was 57.2\% (111 of 194 hard-stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5\% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95\% confidence interval, 0.045-0.33). However, the study was terminated early because of four unintended consequences identified among patients in the intervention group: a delay of treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in two patients and a delay of treatment with warfarin in another two patients
    - Conclusions: An electronic hard-stop alert as part of an inpatient CPOE system seemed to be extremely effective in changing prescribing habits.
    However, this intervention precipitated clinically important treatment delays in four patients who needed immediate drug therapy.
    These results illustrate the importance of formal evaluation and monitoring for unintended consequences of programmatic interventions intended to improve prescribing habits

    The study was designed as a quantitative, explanatory field study that was conducted as an RCT.
    The study found that these alerts can help to reduce the number of alert-triggering orders.
    But it also found that the hard-stop alert led to clinically important treatment delays in four patients.\\
    Antwort & Study ``Unintended Effects of a Computerized Physician Order Entry Nearly Hard-stop Alert'': The effectiveness of a nearly ``hard-stop'' alert was evaluated in a field study.
    The data was collected via analysis of the prescriptions in the CPOE systems.
    The overall data collection method is thus a quantitative observation of available data.\\

    Kontext & \#\#\# 5.5.2 Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Setting
    Besides evaluating the effect of an intervention, evaluation may also try to understand reasons for successful or unsuccessful implementation of an application system.
    For these kinds of questions, qualitative studies are often chosen.
    Table 5.2 presents the abstract of such a qualitative study.
    The authors analyzed need, barriers, and facilitators for clinical decision support (CDS) in primary care.
    The study was performed as a qualitative, exploratory field study.

    Table 5.2: Abstract from ``Clinical Decision Support for Worker Health: A Five-Site Qualitative Needs Assessment in Primary Care Settings.'' [6]

    - Background: Although patients who work and have related health issues are usually first seen in primary care, providers in these settings do not routinely ask questions about work.
    Guidelines to help manage such patients are rarely used in primary care.
    Electronic health record systems (EHRS) with worker health CDS tools have potential for assisting these practices
    - Objective: This study aimed to identify the need for and barriers and facilitators related to implementation of CDS tools for the clinical management of working patients in a variety of primary care settings
    - Methods: We used a qualitative design that included analysis of interview transcripts and observational field notes from 10 clinics in five organizations
    - Results: We interviewed 83 providers, staff members, managers, informatics and IT experts, and leaders and spent 35 h observing.
    We identified eight themes in four categories related to CDS for worker health (operational issues, usefulness of proposed CDS, effort and time-related issues, and topic-specific issues). These categories were classified as facilitators or barriers to the use of the CDS tools.
    Facilitators related to operational issues include current technical feasibility and new work patterns associated with the coordinated care model.
    Facilitators concerning usefulness include users' need for awareness and evidence-based tools, appropriateness of the proposed CDS for their patients, and the benefits of population health data.
    Barriers that are effort-related include the additional time the proposed CDS might take as well as other pressing organizational priorities.
    Barriers that are topic-specific include sensitive issues related to health and work and the complexities of information about work
    - Conclusion: We discovered several themes not previously described that can guide future CDS development: technical feasibility of the proposed CDS within a commercial electronic health record (EHR), the sensitive nature of some CDS content, and the need to assist the entire health care team in managing worker health

    The authors found several factors that may hinder or foster the use of CDS in primary care.
    The results of this multi-center study can now be used to implement CDS in commercial application software products for primary care.\\

    Frage & In which of the health care settings above will the function medical admission need to be supported? \\
    Umformuliert & In which health care settings will the function medical admission need to be supported? \\
    Antwort & The function ``medical admission'' is relevant in several health care and research settings.
    It comprises the provision of forms for documenting medical history, documenting diagnoses, and scanning documents from referring physician and other sources of information about the medical history.
    It is obvious that this function needs to be supported in hospitals, nursing homes, ambulatory nursing organizations, and medical offices.
    Yet it is often also necessary in research settings, for example, when a person is recruited for a clinical trial and their data are entered into an EDC system.
    Furthermore, therapeutic offices need this function for documentation purposes, as do rehabilitation facilities and-to a limited extent-wellness or sports facilities.
    For personal environments, medical admission also plays a role, especially in telecare situations or when prevention measures are conducted, respectively.\\

    Can you imagine situations where the requirements of two stakeholder groups differ or even contradict each other? What does this imply when building health information systems? \\
    Antwort & While a patient is being treated for an acute disease, the requirements of the treating physicians and nurses as well as of the patient and relatives may differ.
    For example, patient and relatives want to be kept informed of ongoing diagnostic outcomes (e.g., lab values) as soon as possible.
    However, physicians and nurses may want to discuss the findings with the patient in person to avoid causing unnecessary confusion and stress in the patient.
    Therefore, the health information system must be able to provide detailed information to physicians and nurses, but it must be able to only present confirmed information to the patient (e.g., via a patient portal). \\

    Glial cells form another subsystem that provides support and nutrition to the neurons.

    The hospital can be understood as a system comprising at least two subsystems: the subsystem where clinical care takes place and the subsystem where management takes place.
    The clinical subsystem can again be split into several subsystems, such as inpatient area, outpatient area, and specialized diagnostic or therapeutic areas.
    The inpatient area itself can be divided into various subsystems, each represented by one ward.

    The nurse then uses the NDMS to plan nursing care.
    Now consider the types of integration and discuss how this nurse would recognize a high (or low) level of data integration, semantic integration, user interface integration, context integration, feature integration, and process integration.\\
    Antwort & Data integration would be considered high when the nurse documents patient administrative data only once in the patient administration system and then can use this data in the NDMS.

    Semantic integration would be considered high when the nurse documents a nursing diagnosis using a standardized terminology (such as NANDA) and when this standardized diagnosis is then understood by the NDMS that may, for example, suggest a standard nursing care plan for this patient based on this diagnosis.

    User interface integration would be considered high when the user interfaces of both application systems look sufficiently similar, which reduces the risk of data entry or data interpretation errors.
    For example, in both application systems, the names of the patients are always displayed at the same place, the birthdates are presented in standardized form, and colors that are used to highlight important information are used in the same way.

    Context integration would be considered high when the user context and the patient context is preserved when the nurse shifts from one application system to the other.
    The nurse thus would not have to repeat user login or the selection of the patient in the second application system.

    Feature integration would be considered high when only the patient administration system offers the needed administrative features (such as documentation of patient address). The nurse would be able to call up these features from within the NDMS.

    Process integration would be considered high if both application systems work together in a highly integrated way so that the process of patient admission and nursing care planning from the point of view of the nurse is supported in an efficient way.\\

    Functions: patient administration and all functions related to patient care (Sect. 3.3.2.1).
    Project portfolio and migration plan:

    - Year 1: Introduction of a patient administration system.

    - Year 2: Introduction of a CIS, an LIS and an RIS.

    - Year 3: Introduction of a DAS and a PACS.

    - Year 4: Introduction of an OMS and of a PDMS.

    - Year 5: Introduction of a DWS and of a patient portal.

    Please note: This is a simplified solution.
    Other solutions may be valid, too.
    In case the different application systems are meant to come from different vendors, an integration technology such as a communication server needs to be implemented.\\

    Explain your choice.\\
    Antwort & Several solutions are possible here.
    One possible solution:

    1. HIS user per mobile IT tool: Efficient information logistics everywhere (e.g., at the patient's bedside) requires enough mobile IT tools.

    2. Number of application systems: I would strive for an integrated information system and reduce the number of application systems in the long run in order to reduce integration problems.

    3. HIS budget in relation to the overall hospital budget: Sufficient funding is the precondition for high-quality and well-integrated information system and the necessary competent IT staff.\\

    Frage & Information systems managers can be partly compared to architects.
    Read the following statement and discuss similarities and differences between information system architects and building architects [8]:

    ``We are architects.
    [...] We have designed numerous buildings, used by many people.
    [...] We know what users want.
    We know their complaints: buildings that get in the way of the things they want to do.
    [...] We also know the users' joy of relaxing, working, learning, buying, manufacturing, and worshipping in buildings which were designed with love and care as well as function in mind.
    [...] We are committed to the belief that buildings can help people to do their jobs or may impede them and that good buildings bring joy as well as efficiency.'' \\

    Antwort & Health information managers can indeed be compared with architects.
    Health information managers design information systems that are used by many different user groups.
    Health information managers regularly monitor the quality of information systems to obtain feedback and to improve the information system.
    Health information managers understand that information systems support many different functions for many different user groups within health care facilities.
    Health information managers make sure that the application systems are user-friendly and support working processes in an efficient way.
    Health information managers understand that an information system serves the overall goal of a health care facility and ultimately serves the need of the patients.\\

    Frage & A clinical researcher at Ploetzberg Hospital has won a grant to set up a register for patients who have received a knee endoprosthesis.
    Disease registers are research databases for collecting data about a specific disease, aiming for full coverage of the respective patient collective.
    The aim of a knee endoprosthesis registry is to collect longitudinal data to find out which type of endoprosthesis works best over time.
    The researcher wants to integrate data from patient-reported outcome questionnaires, findings from inpatient or outpatient visits at the hospital, and results from laboratory examinations.
    Which entity types need to be integrated and from which application components do they come? Devise a plan how you would set up a sustainable research architecture, i.e., an architecture that also could be used in other research settings and for different disease or research entities, considering Sect. 6.6. \\

    Antwort & The following entity types have to be integrated: patient, person, diagnosis, finding, health record, medical procedure, patient record, self-gathered symptoms, material, medical device, classification, nomenclature.

    Application components to be integrated depend on local settings and implementation but will likely include: patient administration system, MDMS, LIS, OMS, PDMS, and self-diagnosis systems (e.g., an app for collecting patient-reported outcome data) or patient portals.

    A research architecture for setting up multiple registries might include a DWS for research that is fed via ETL processes from the above-mentioned application components and can be tapped for data in different use cases or research scenarios.
    Finally, an open platform architecture would enable reuse of patient data in various research contexts.\\
