##Introduction

‘What is a health information system? The literature defines health information systems
(HIS) in many different ways and presents various views. Some articles focus on the orga-
nizational aspects of information processing, while others focus on the technology used.
To begin with, we understand a health information system as the information processing
and information storing subsystem of a health care organization, which may be a single
institution, for example, a hospital, or a group of health care institutions like a health care
network.

This book discusses the significance of information processing in health care, with an
emphasis on information processing in hospitals, the progress in information and commu-
nication technology, and the importance of systematic information management. Nearly
all people working in health care institutions have an enormous demand for information,
which has to be fulfilled in order to achieve high-quality and efficient patient care. For
example, physicians and nurses need information concerning the health status of patients
from different departments of their hospital. They also need current medical knowledge as
a basis for their clinical decisions. In addition, the management of a hospital needs up-to-
date information about the hospital’s costs and services. Of course, the quality of informa-
tion processing is important for the competitiveness of a hospital. Consequently, this
system of information processing can be regarded as the memory and nervous system of
the respective health care institution.

The subject of information processing is quite complex. Nearly all groups and all areas
in a health care institution depend on the quality of information processing. The amount of
information processing is tremendous. Additionally, the information needs of the different
groups are often based on the same data. Therefore, integrated information processing is
necessary. If health information systems are not systematically managed and operated,
they tend to develop chaotically. This, in turn, leads to negative consequences such as low
data quality, resulting in low quality of patient care and increasing costs. Systematic infor-
mation management can help to prevent such HIS failures and contribute to a high-quality
and efficient patient care.

Well-educated specialists in health informatics/medical informatics, with the knowl-
edge and skills to systematically manage and operate health information systems are there-
fore needed to appropriately and responsibly apply information and communication
technology to the complex information processing environment of health care settings.

This book discusses the typical architectures of health information systems and their
systematic strategic management. A lot of examples will show how certain methods and

tools can be used to describe and assess architectures of health information systems and to
support the various information management tasks in an integrated fashion.

This textbook addresses you as a health care and health/medical informatics profes-
sional as well as a student in health/medical informatics and health information manage-
ment. It should be regarded as an introduction to this complex subject. For a deeper
understanding, you will need additional knowledge and, foremost, practice in this field.

If you are not familiar with patient care and medical research, you can find an introduc-
tory chapter to health institutions and their respective information processing tasks. If you
are not familiar with information systems, you can find an introductory chapter to informa-
tion system basics.

‘We want to provide you with a terminology about health information systems which is
as complete and sound as possible. To support this, we compiled a catalog of the most
important terms as a thesaurus at the end of the book. The terms cataloged are underlined
in the text, where they are explained. If you find terms which are printed in italics, these
terms will refer to
® actions to be undertaken in health care in order to process data and information and to

thereby contribute to the mission of health care (i.e., hospital functions).

e computer-based tools to support professionals in health care to undertake these actions

(i.e., application components).

You will find explanations of the respective terms in Sects. 6.3, 6.4.
After reading this book, you should be able to answer the following questions:
eo Why is systematic information processing in health care institutions important?
® What are appropriate models for health information systems?
e How do health information systems look like and what architectures are appropriate?
e How can we assess the quality of health information systems?
e How can we strategically manage health information systems?
In the end, we are confident that you will be able to answer the question “How can good

#Health Institutions and Information ProcessingIntroduction

Health information systems strongly influence quality and efficiency of health care, and technical
progress offers advanced opportunities to support health care. In this chapter, we will discuss the
interrelation between health information systems on one side and health care on the other side.
After reading this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:

e What is the significance of information systems for health care?

e How does technical progress affect health care?

eo Why is systematic information management important?Significance of Information Processing in Health care

2.2.1
Information Processing as Quality Factor

Decisions of health care professionals are based on vast amounts of information about the
patient’s health state. It is essential for the quality of patient care and for the quality of
hospital management to fulfill these information needs.

‘When a patient is admitted to a hospital, a physician or nurse first needs information
about the reason for patient admission and the patient history. Later, she or he needs results
from services such as laboratory and radiology (Fig. 2.1), which are some of the most fre-
quent diagnostic procedures. In general, clinical patient-related information should be
available on time, and it should be up-to-date and valid. For example, the recent laboratory
report should be available on the ward within 2 h after the request. If this is not the case, if
it comes too late, or is old or even wrong, quality of care and patient safety is at risk. An
incorrect laboratory report may lead to erroneous and even harmful treatment decisions.
Additionally, if examinations have to be repeated or lost findings have to be searched for,
the costs of health care may increase. Information should be documented adequately,
enabling health care professionals to access the information needed and to make sound
decisions.

People working in hospital administration also must be well informed in order to carry
out their tasks. They should be informed timely and receive current information. If the infor-
mation flow is too slow, bills are written days or even weeks after the patient’s discharge. If
information is missing, payable services cannot be billed, and the hospital's income will be
reduced. For example, under certain circumstances, the amount payable by the health insur-
ance is reduced, if the invoice from the hospital arrives after a certain deadline.

Hospital management also has an enormous information need. Up-to-date information
about costs and proceeds are necessary as a basis for controlling the enterprise. Information
about the quality of patient care is equally important, for example, about the form and sever-
ity of patients’ illnesses, about nosocomial infections, or about complication rates of thera-
peutic procedures. Ifthis information is not accurate, not on time, or incomplete, the hospitals
work cannot be controlled adequately, increasing the risks of management errors.

Thus, information processing is an important quality factor in health care and, in par-
ticular, in hospitals.

2.2.2
Information Processing as Cost Factor

In 2007, member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) spent between 6 and 15% of their total gross domestic product (GDP) on health care.'

'Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). OECD Health Data 2008.
Statistics and Indicators for 30 countries. http://www.oecd.org
#2.2 Significance of Information Processing in Health care 5

In 2006, the costs for the approximately 2,100 German hospitals with their 510,000 beds
amounted to €60 billion; 1.1 million people worked in these organizations in Germany, and 17
million inpatients were treated.? In the USA, hospital spending was nearly $600 billion. The
overall US national health expenditure reached $2.2 trillion in 2007, and accounted for 16.2%
of the Gross Domestic Product.’

A relevant percentage of those costs is spent on information processing. However, the
total percentage of information processing can only be estimated. Already in the 1960s,
studies observed that 25% of a hospital’s costs are due to (computer-based and non-
computer-based) information processing.* However, such an estimate depends on the defi-
nition of information processing. In general, the investment costs (including purchase,
adaptation, introduction, and training) must be distinguished from the operating costs
(including continued maintenance and support as well as staff), and the costs for computer-
based from the costs for non-computer-based information processing (which still are often
much higher in hospitals).

Looking at computer-based information processing, the annual budget that health care
institutions spend on information and communication technology (ICT) (including com-
puter systems, computer networks, and computer-based application components) was in
2006 between 2.5% and 3.3% of the total hospital operating expense, depending on the
number of beds.® In many hospitals, the annual budget is even lower. Most hospital chief
information officers (CIOs) expect an increasing budget.®

‘When looking at non-computer-based information processing (see Fig. 2.2, for exam-
ple), the numbers become increasingly vague. However, we can expect that, for example,
the annual operating costs (including personnel costs) for a non-computer-based archive,
storing about 300,000-400,000 new patients records each year, may easily amount to more
than €500,000. A typical, standardized, machine-readable form, including two carbon cop-
ies (a radiology order, for example) costs approximately €0.50. A typical inpatient record
at a university hospital consists of about 40 documents.

Based on these figures, it becomes apparent that information processing in health
care is an important cost factor and considerably significant for a national economy.
It is clear that, on the one hand, efficient information processing offers vast potential
for cost reductions. On the other hand, inefficient information processing leads to cost
increases.

Information as Productivity Factor

In the nineteenth century, many societies were characterized by rising industry and
industrial production. By the second half of the twentieth century, the idea of
communicating and processing data by means of computers and computer networks
was already emerging. Today we speak of the twenty-first century as the century of
information technology, or of an “information society.” Informatics and information
and communication technology (ICT) are playing a key role. Information, bound to a
medium of matter or energy, but largely independent of place and time, shall be made
available to people at any time and in any place imaginable. Information shall find its
way to people, not vice versa.

Today, information belongs to the most important productivity factors of a hospital.
Productivity is defined as a ratio of output and input. All resources like personnel, medical
devices, etc. are part of the input. Therefore, from an economic point of view, productivity
of a hospital might be defined as the ratio of the number of cases and full-time employees.
If, however, output is considered as quality of patient care, it is much more difficult to
calculate productivity. Therefore, a lot of reliable clinical data are needed. For high-quality
patient care and economic management of a hospital, it is essential that the hospital infor-
mation system can make correct information fully available on time. This is also increas-
ingly important for the competitiveness of hospitals.

2.24
Holistic View of the Patient

Information processing in a hospital should offer a comprehensive, holistic view of
the patient and of the hospital. “Holistic” in this context means to have a complete
picture of the care of a patient available, independent of the health care institutions
#2.2 Significance of Information Processing in Health care 7

and hospital departments in which the patient has been or will be treated. This holistic
view on the patient can reduce undesired consequences of highly specialized medicine
with various departments and health care professionals involved in patient care.
Despite highly differentiated diagnostics and therapy, and the multitude of people and
areas in a hospital, adequate information processing (and a good hospital information
system) can help to make information about a patient available completely (Fig. 2.3).
As specialization in medicine and health care increases, so does the fragmentation of
information, which makes combining information into such a holistic view more and
more necessary. However, it must be clearly ensured that only authorized personnel
can access patient data and data about the hospital as an enterprise.

2.2.5
Hospital Information System as Memory and Nervous System

Figuratively speaking, a hospital information system might be regarded as the memory
and the nervous system of a hospital. A hospital information system, comprising the
information processing and storage in a hospital (Figs. 2.4 and 2.5), to a certain extent
can be compared to the information processing of a human being. The hospital infor-
mation system also receives, transmits, processes, stores, and presents information.
The quality of a hospital information system is essential for a hospital, again figura-
tively, in order to be able to adequately recognize and store facts, to remember them,
and to act on them.

2.3.1
Impact on the Quality of Health Care

Progress in information and communication technology (ICT) changes societies and
affects the costs and quality of information processing in health care. It is thus useful to
take a look at the world of information and communication technology.

Tremendous improvements in diagnostics have been made available by modem tech-
nology, for example, in the area of medical signal and image processing. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging and computer tomography, for example, would not have been possible
without improvements in information processing and information methodology and with-
out modern information and communication technology (see Fig. 2.6). Improved diagnos-
tics then lead to an improvement in therapy. Some therapies, for example, in neurosurgery
or radiotherapy, are possible mainly due to the progress in ICT. The same is true in the field
of medical biotechnology: the development of new drug agents, research in molecular
principles of diseases, and the resulting new patient-specific therapeutic option enable a
better treatment of patients.

Nowadays, clinical research can to an increasing degree be conducted with success, and
be internationally competitive, only if carried out on an interdisciplinary, often also

inter-regional or international, and collaborative basis. This collaboration has been and is
fostered by integrated systems of information technology. The translation of medical
research outcomes into new therapies needs tight information exchange from “bench” to
“bed”, that is, from research to patient care. Vice versa information about experiences with
therapies is collected by computer-based tools within clinical trials and is resent to and
carefully analyzed at research institutions.

Important progress due to improvements in modern ICT can also be observed in infor-
mation systems of health care organizations. The role of computer-based information
systems, together with clinical documentation and knowledge-based decision support sys-
tems, can hardly be overestimated in respect to the quality of health care, as the volume of
data available today is much greater than it was a few years ago.

23.2
Impact on Economics

For many countries, the vision of an “information society” has become a reality. Nearly
every modern economic branch is shaped by information processing and information and
communication technology.

The worldwide information and communication technology market volume is estimated
at nearly €2.5 trillion in 2009 with a growth rate of about 5% per year.” Germany’s expected
total annual turnover on information and communication technology was approximately
€146 billion in 2008. Generally, half of this money is spent on information technology (data
processing and data communication equipment, software, and related services) and the other
half on communication technology (telecommunication equipment and related services).

ICT has become a major factor for quality and efficiency of health care worldwide.
ICT in health care also emerged to a leading industry branch. The percentage of health
care ICT on the worldwide ICT market is difficult to estimate. The following numbers
may indicate the significance of ICT in health care: In the U.S. the estimated total expen-
ditures of ICT equipment and software in health care were about $21 billion in 2007,
which is 8.1% of the total US ICT expenditures.’ Reports from the European Union (EU)

state that the eHealth industry in the EU (defined as comprising clinical information sys-
tems, telemedicine and homecare, and regional networks) was estimated “to be worth
close to €21 billion in 2006” and that the global eHealth industry “has the potential to be
the third largest industry in the health sector with a global turnover of €50-60 billion”!
Many countries established programs to force information and communication techno-
logy especially in the eHealth segment with investment volumes between $50 million and
$11.5 billion."

One might have doubts about the validity of these rather rough numbers. However, they
all exemplify the following: There is a significant and increasing economic relevance not
only for information and communication technology in general but also in health care.

23.3
Changing Health Care

Now once more, what changes in health care do we expect through information and com-
munication technology?

The developments mentioned will probably continue into the next decade at least at the
same rate as given today. The development of information and communication technology
will continue to have a considerable effect on our societies in general and on our health
care systems in particular.

The use of computer-based tools in health care is dramatically increasing, and new
technologies such as mobile devices and multifunctional bedside terminals will prolifer-
ate. Those mobile information processing tools offer both communication and information
processing features. Wireless networks are standard in many hospitals. Computer-based
training systems strongly support efficient learning for health care professionals.
Documentation efforts are continuously rising and lead to more sophisticated computer-
based documentation tools (see Fig. 2.7). Decision support tools, for example, in the con-
text of drug prescription, support high-quality care. Communication is increasingly
supported by electronic means. The globalization of providing health care and the coop-
eration of health care professionals is increasing, and patients and health care professionals
seek reliable health information on the Internet. Large health databases are available for
everyone at his or her work place and global companies offer personal health records
worldwide for everyone. Providing high-quality and efficient health care will continue to
be strongly correlated with high-quality information and communication technology and a

sound methodology for systematically processing information. However, the newest infor-
mation and communication technologies do not guarantee high-quality information pro-
cessing. Both information processing technologies and methodologies must adequately
and responsibly be applied and, as will be pointed out later on, systematically managed.Importance of Systematic Information Management

24.1
Affected People and Areas

Nearly all people and all areas of a hospital are affected by the quality of the information
system, as most of them need various types of information (e.g., about the patient) in their
daily work. The patient can certainly profit most from high-quality information processing
since it contributes to the quality of patient care and to reducing costs.

The professional groups working in a hospital, especially physicians, nurses, and
administrative personnel, and others are also directly affected by the quality of the infor-
mation system. As they spend 25% or even more of their time on information handling,
they directly profit from good and efficient information processing. However, they will
also feel the consequences if information processing is poor.
#2.4 Importance of Systematic Information Management 13

24.2
Amount of Information Processing

The amount of information processing in hospitals, especially in larger ones, should not be
underestimated. Let us look at a typical German university medical center. It is an enter-
prise encompassing staff of approximately 4,500 people, an annual budget of approxi-
mately €250 million, and, as a maximum care facility, numerous tasks in research,
education, and patient care. It consists of up to 60 departments and up to 100 wards with
up to 1,500 beds and about 100 outpatient units. Annually, approximately, 50,000 inpa-
tients and 250,000 outpatients are treated, and 20,000 operation reports, 250,000 discharge
letters, 20,000 pathology reports, 100,000 microbiology reports, 200,000 radiology reports,
and 800,000 clinical chemistry reports are written.

Each year, approximately 300,000-400,000 new patient records, summing up to
approximately eight million pieces of paper, are created (Fig. 2.8). When stored in a paper-
based way, an annual record volume of approximately 1,500 m is generated. In Germany,
for example, they should be archived over a period of 30 years. When stored digitally, the
annual data volume needed is expected to be around 10-15 terabytes, including digital
images and digital signals.

The computer-based tools of a university medical center encompass more than hundred
of the computer-based application components, thousands of workstations and other

Fig. 2.8 A study nurse in an outpatient unit dealing with a multitude of paper-based forms
#14 2 Health Institutions and Information Processing

terminals, and more than hundred servers (larger computer systems that offer services and
features to other computer systems), and the respective network.

The numbers in the majority of hospitals are much smaller. In larger ones we will find,
for example, about ten departments with 600 beds and about 20,000 inpatients every year.
In industrialized countries 1,500 staff members would work there, and the annual budget
of the hospital would be about €80 million. Especially in rural areas, we can also find hos-
pitals with only one department and fewer than 50 beds.Sharing the Same Data

There are different reasons for pursuing holistic and integrated information processing.
The most important reason is that various groups of health care professionals within and
outside health care institutions need the same data (Fig. 2.9).

For example, a surgeon in a hospital documents the diagnoses and therapies of an oper-
ated patient in an operation report. This report serves as basis for the discharge letter. The
discharge letter is also an important document to communicate with the admitting institu-
tion, normally a general practitioner. Diagnosis and therapy are also important for statistics
about patient care and for quality management. Equally, they contain important informa-
tion for the systematic nursing care of a patient. Diagnostic and therapeutic data are also
relevant for billing.

In Germany, for example, some basic administrative data must be communicated to the
respective health insurance company online within 3 days after patient admission and after
discharge. In a coded form, they are the basis for accounting. Additionally, managing and
controlling a hospital is possible only if the cost (such as consumption of materials or
drugs) of the treatment can be compared to the characteristics and severity of the illness,
characterized by diagnosis and therapy.

care professionals on a ward

#2.4 Importance of Systematic Information Management 15Integrated Information Processing to Satisfy Information Needs

Information processing has to integrate the partly overlapping information needs of the
different groups and areas of a hospital (see Fig. 2.10).

Systematic, integrated information processing in a hospital has advantages not only for
the patient, but also for the health care professionals, the health insurance companies, and
the hospital owners. If information processing is not conducted globally across institutions,
but locally, for example, in professional groups (physicians, nurses, and administrative
staff) or areas (clinical departments, institutes, and administration), this corresponds to tra-
ditional separation politics and leads to isolated information processing groups, such as “the
administration” or “the clinic.” In this case, the quality of the hospital information system
clearly decreases while the costs for information processing increase due to the necessity
for multiple data collection and analysis. Finally, this has disadvantages for the patient and,
when seen from a national economical point of view, for the whole population.

However, integration of information processing should consider not only information
processing in one health care organization, but also information processing among differ-
ent institutions (such as integrated health care delivery systems). The achievements of
modern medicine, particularly in the field of acute diseases, have led to the paradoxical
result that chronic diseases and multimorbidity increasingly gain in relevance. Among
other reasons, this is due to more people being able to live to old age. Moreover, in many

countries, an increasing willingness to switch doctors and a higher regional mobility exist
among patients. The degree of highly specialized and distributed patient care creates a
great demand for integrated information processing among health care professionals and
among health care institutions such as hospitals, general practices, laboratories, etc. In
turn, this raises the need for more comprehensive documentation and efficient, compre-
hensive information systems.

2.4.5
Raising the Quality of Patient Care and Reducing Costs

Systematic information processing is the key factor for raising quality and reducing
costs. What does “systematic” mean in this context? “Unsystematic” can, in a positive
sense, mean creative, spontaneous, or flexible. However, “unsystematic” can also mean
chaotic, purposeless, and ineffective, and also entail high costs compared to the benefits
gained.

“Systematic” in this context means purposeful and effective, and with great benefit
regarding the costs. Bearing this in mind, it is obvious that information processing in a
health care institution should be managed systematically. Due to the importance of infor-
mation processing as a quality and cost factor, an institution has to invest systematically
in its health information system. These investments deal with both staff and tools for
information processing. They aim at increasing quality of patient care and at reducing
costs.

Unsystematic information processing normally leads to a low quality of health information
systems, and the information needs of the staff and departments cannot be adequately satis-
fied. When health information systems are not systematically managed, they tend to develop
in a chaotic way. This has severe consequences: decreased data quality, and higher costs,
especially for tools and information processing staff, not to mention aspects such as data pro-
tection and data security violation. Even worse, insufficiently managed information systems
can contribute to breakdowns in established clinical workflows, to a reduced efficiency of
care, to user boycott, to decreased quality of care and — in the end — even endanger patient
safety.

To adequately process information and apply information and communication technol-
ogy, knowledge and skills for these tasks are required.

2.4.6
Basis of Systematic Information Processing

If the hospital management decides to invest in systematic information processing (and not
in fighting the effects of chaotic information processing, which normally means much
higher investments), it decides to manage the hospital information system in a systematic
way. The management of a hospital information system forms and controls the information
system, and it ensures its efficient operation.

Knowledge Access to Improve Patient Care

Imagine the following situation: Ursula B. was pregnant with quintuplets. She had already
spent more than 5 months in a University Medical Center. She had to spend most of this
time lying in bed. During the course of her pregnancy, her physical problems increased.
From the 28th week on, she suffered severe respiratory distress.

Professor L., the pediatrician, who was also involved in her treatment, had the fol-
lowing question: What are the chances of the infants being born healthy at this gesta-
tional age?

He went to a computer, which is connected to the computer network of the University
Medical Center. The physician called up a function “knowledge access” and, as applica-
tion component, a literature database (MEDLINE), which contains the current state of
the art of medical knowledge worldwide (Fig. 2.11).

The following information resulted from this knowledge access: Several publications
stated that only slim chances exist for all infants to survive in good health. If they are born
during the 28th week of pregnancy, the chance for survival is about 15%. In case of birth
during the 30th week, their chances would improve to about 75%. Also, according to the
literature, further delay of the delivery does not improve the prognosis of the quintuplets.

The physician discussed the results with the expectant mother. Despite her respiratory
problems, she had the strength to endure 2 more weeks.

On January 21st of the respective year, the quintuplets were born well and healthy at
the University Medical Center (Fig. 2.12). A team of 25 physicians, nurses, and mid-
wives assisted during the delivery. Appropriate knowledge access was of crucial
importance.

Today, knowledge access at a ward is in many hospitals an integrated part of a hospital
information system.

You may wonder, in which year and in which medical center the quintuplets were born.
It was in 1999 at the Heidelberg University Medical Center. Although this real example
dates back more than 10 years we found it still worth to report on because it shows clearly
how important it is to have information and knowledge available, and in this respect is
pioneering for the future trends.

By the way, all quintuples are well and Prof. L., the attending physician, became their

analyze a (fictitious) clinical register from the (fictitious) Pltzberg Medical Center and
Medical School (PMC). PMC will be used in examples and exercises in this book.

Table 2.1 shows statistics with patients having diagnosis A, for example, rheumatism,
and treated during the years 8, for example, 1991-2001, at PMC. The patients have either
received standard therapy, Verum, or a new therapy, Novum.

Comparing the success rates of Novum and Verum, one might conclude that the
new therapy is better than the standard therapy. Applying an appropriate statistical test
would lead to a low p value and a significant result. The success rate was also analyzed
by sex. This resulted in Verum leading in female patients as well as in male patients.

Is one of our conclusions erroneous? Or maybe both? What would a systematic design
and analysis of such a register be? After looking at the data, one can identify a fairly simple
reason for this so-called Simpson’s paradox. The methodology for processing information
systematically ought to prevent such errors; however, it is far more complex.The WHO eHealth Resolution™

Estimated Impact of eHealth to Improve Quality and Efficiency of Patient Care

This example is taken from a study report presented by Gartner on behalf of the Swedish
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs.'s

This study analyzed the potential benefits of an increased usage of eHealth in six EU

member states:

..There is a significant healthcare improvement potential using eHealth as a catalyst

Examples of quantified potentials include:

Five million yearly outpatient prescription errors could be avoided through the use of
Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions.

100,000 yearly inpatient adverse drug events could be avoided through Computerized
Physician Order Entry and Clinical Decision Support. This would in turn free up
700,000 bed-days yearly, an opportunity for increasing throughput and decreasing wait-
ing times, corresponding to a value of almost €300 million.

49,000 cases of inpatient Hospital Acquired Infections could be avoided every year
collectively through the use of Business Intelligence and Data Mining for real time
detection of in-hospital infections. This could increase availability by over 270,000
bed-days, resulting in opportunity savings of over €131 million.

11,000 deaths caused by complications related to diabetes could collectively be
reduced through Electronic Medical Records with Chronic Disease Management
capabilities.

5.6 million admissions to hospitals for chronically ill patients could be avoided collec-
tively through the use of Telemedicine and Home Health Monitoring.

Nine million bed-days yearly could be freed up through the use of Computer-Based
Patient Records, an opportunity for either increasing throughput or decreasing waiting
times, corresponding to a value of nearly €3.7 billion.

"eLearning is understood in this context to mean use of any electronic technology and media in

support of learning.

#2 2 Health Institutions and Information Processing

e Patients can become more involved and accountable for the management of their
chronic conditions through access to knowledge based best practices via an EMR with
Chronic Disease Management capabilities and communication with their physicians
through a Patient Portal.

e Patients can have more control on how and when to engage with their physicians
through technologies such as Patient Portals and Personal Health Records that enable
alternative ways of communication and consultation such as e-mail and e-visits.”Exercises

information processing practices in these areas, and two examples of “poor” information
processing practices. Which positive or negative consequences for the patients could they
have?

e Patient administration

® Cardiologic ward

e LaboratorySummary

Information processing is an important quality factor, but an enormous cost factor as well.
It is also becoming a productivity factor. Information processing should offer a holistic
view of the patient and of the hospital. A hospital information system can be regarded as
the memory and nervous system of a hospital.

Information and communication technology has become economically important and
decisive for the quality of health care. It will continue to change health care.

The integrated processing of information is important, because

e all groups of people and all areas of a hospital depend on its quality,

e the amount of information processing in hospitals is considerable, and
® health care professionals frequently work with the same data.

The systematic processing of information
e contributes to high-quality patient care , and
e reduces costs.

Information processing in hospitals is complex. Therefore,

e the systematic management and operation of hospital information systems, and

e medical informatics specialists responsible for the management, and operation of
hospital information systems are needed.
